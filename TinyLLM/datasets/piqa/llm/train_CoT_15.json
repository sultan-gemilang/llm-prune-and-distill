    "Use a shovel or pick to dig into the ground several inches away from the bulb clump and work your way around, taking care you don\u2019t accidentally cut into the bulbs. Lift the clump and gently shake off excess soil to reveal the bulbs. Divide daffodil bulbs by twisting and pulling them off the clump. It usually takes a slight tug to separate the roots from the clump. Dispose of all damaged, mushy, infected looking bulbs. If you wish to replant right away, sow them at the new site at the original depth, making sure the leafy growth is above, the bulb and white stem are under the soil line. Water well after replanting. If you intend to replant daffodils in fall, you\u2019ll need to store them properly so they can survive the stretch. Lay them all out indoors on clean, dry newspapers and leave them be for 7-10 days. Remove the leaves when they\u2019re crisp and brown and gently brush off any dirt that\u2019s still sticking to the bulbs. Go easy, there\u2019s no need to wash the bulbs or to get them absolutely spot free. Place the bulbs in nylon or mesh bags (cleaned onion sacks will do just fine too), label them and then store them in a cool, dry but ventilated location. Come fall, take out bulbs and inspect them.

Lift the clump and gently shake off excess soil to reveal the bulbs.    Divide daffodil bulbs by twisting and pulling them off the clump. It usually takes a slight tug to separate the roots from the clump. Dispose of all damaged, mushy, infected looking bulbs.    If you wish to replant right away, sow them at the new site at the original depth, making sure the leafy growth is above, the bulb and white stem are under the soil line. Water well after replanting.    If you intend to replant daffodils in fall, you\u2019ll need to store them properly so they can survive the stretch. Lay them all out indoors on clean, dry newspapers and leave them be for 7-10 days.    Remove the leaves when they\u2019re crisp and brown and gently brush off any dirt that\u2019s still sticking to the bulbs. Go easy, there\u2019s no need to wash the bulbs or to get them absolutely spot free.
