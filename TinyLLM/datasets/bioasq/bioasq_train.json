        "question": "Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors have a conserved function in regulating metazoan lifespan. \n In contrast to FoxO1, FoxO3a and FoxO6 were specifically diminished in the CNS of HFD animals possibly contributing to the reduced lifespan observed in these animals. \n Interestingly, many target proteins of AMPK are so-called longevity factors, e.g., SIRT1, p53, and FoxOs, which not only can increase the stress resistance and extend the lifespan of many organisms but also inhibit the inflammatory responses.  \n Components of anti-ageing and autophagy include SirTs and FoxOs. \n Since Sirts and FoxOs are reliable markers of longevity, the results appear to suggest that Longevinex induces longevity after prolonged feeding via induction of autophagy, while it converts death signals into survival signals and provides cardioprotection within a relatively shorter period of time. \n Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, stress resistance, metabolism, and longevity \n In this respect, members of the mammalian forkhead transcription factors of the O class (FoxOs) that include FoxO1, FoxO3, FoxO4 and FoxO6 are increasingly being recognized as exciting prospects for multiple disorders. These transcription factors govern development, proliferation, survival and longevity during multiple cellular environments that can involve oxidative stress.  \n Here we discuss the fascinating but complex role of FoxOs during cellular injury and oxidative stress, progenitor cell development, fertility, angiogenesis, cardiovascular function, cellular metabolism and diabetes, cell longevity, immune surveillance and cancer. \n Many longevity genes, e.g. FoxOs and SIRT1, are inhibitors of NF-kappaB signaling.  \n Interestingly, several longevity genes such as SIRT1, SIRT6, and FoxOs can clearly suppress NF-kappaB signaling and in this way delay the aging process and extend lifespan. \n Yet, FoxOs also can significantly affect normal cell survival and longevity, requiring new treatments for neoplastic growth to modulate novel pathways that integrate cell proliferation, metabolism, inflammation and survival. \n These observations link FoxO function in mammalian systems with the evolutionarily conserved role of FoxO in promotion of stress resistance and longevity in lower phylogenetic systems. Furthermore, these findings have implications for aging in higher organisms and in malignant stem cell biology, and suggest that FoxOs may play an important role in the maintenance and integrity of stem cell compartments in a broad spectrum of tissues. \n Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors are important downstream targets of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and crucial regulators of cell fate. This function of FoxOs relies on their ability to control diverse cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA repair, defense against oxidative stress and ageing. \n This brief review focuses on the molecular mechanisms, cellular effects and resulting organismal phenotypes generated by differentially regulated FoxO proteins and discusses our current understanding of the role of FoxOs in disease and ageing processes. \n In this review, we focus on the several interactions of aging-associated signaling cascades regulated either by Sirtuins and FoxOs or NF-kappaB signaling pathways. We provide evidence that signaling via the longevity factors of FoxOs and SIRT1 can inhibit NF-kappaB signaling and simultaneously protect against inflamm-aging process. \n In diverse species transcription factors belonging to the forkhead/winged helix box gene, group O (FOXO) subfamily have been found to be crucial in downstream suppression of the life-shortening effects of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signalling pathways that, when upregulated, accelerate ageing by suppression of FOXO.  \n In humans, FOXO3a, as well as FOXO1 and -4, and their downstream effectors, could hold the key to counteracting ageing and common diseases. \n FOXO transcription factors have important roles in metabolism, cellular proliferation, stress tolerance, and aging.  \n Can FOXOs modulate longevity?",

        "question": "This testing is used for identifying singlegene disorders, chromosomal abnormalities, mitochondrial disorders, gender selection in non-mendelian disorders with unequal gender distribution, aneuploidy screening, and other preconceptually identified genetic abnormalities in prospective parents.  \n  Although many clinics offer PGD for HA by gender selection, an approach that detects the presence of the underlying F8 mutation has several advantages.  \n Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for gender selection for non-medical reasons has been considered an unethical procedure by several authors and agencies in the Western society on the basis that it could disrupt the sex ratio, that it discriminates against women and that it leads to disposal of normal embryos of the non-desired gender. In this study, the analysis of a large series of PGD procedures for gender selection from a wide geographical area in the USA shows that, in general, there is no deviation in preference towards any specific gender except for a preference of males in some ethnic populations of Chinese, Indian and Middle Eastern origin that represent a small percentage of the US population.  \n  In response to one specific question, one-third of the couples agreed to use the donor child as a lifetime organ donor and supported the use of PGD for non-medical gender selection.  \n More specifically, I illustrate how the prescriptions of deliberative democracy can be applied to the issue of regulating non-medical uses of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), such as gender selection.  \n Private clinics were more likely than other programs to be on either the East or West Coast, list certain PGD risks (e.g., diagnostic error), note that PGD was new or controversial, reference source of PGD information, provide accuracy rates of genetic testing of embryos, and offer gender selection for social reasons. \n The purpose of this article is to ascertain and appraise the ethical issues inherent to the utilisation of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for gender selection in infertile patients anticipating undergoing a medically indicated assisted reproductive technique procedure. Performance of preimplantation genetic diagnosis per request specifically for gender selection by an infertile couple undergoing medically indicated assisted reproductive technique may not breach the principles of ethics, and is unlikely to alter the population balance of sexes. \n One possible use of PGD is to perform gender selection for couples whose offspring are at increased risk of disorders that do not follow Mendelian inheritance, but which are substantially more common in one sex than another (unequal sex incidence). Here, we examine the clinical and ethical issues to be considered prior to offering PGD gender selection to reduce the risk of a child being affected by a non-Mendelian condition with unequal sex incidence.  \n New uses of PGD have been reported in the past year for screening embryos for susceptibility to cancer, for late-onset diseases, for HLA-matching for existing children, and for gender.  \n This article describes current and likely future uses of PGD, and then analyses the ethical issues posed by new uses of PGD to screen embryos for susceptibility and late-onset conditions, for HLA-matching for tissue donation to an existing child, and for gender selection. \n The use of PGD for sex selection arouses considerable debate, especially in countries like India that have a marked cultural preference for boys. It is argued that using PGD for sex selection is a treatment option that can be ethically offered to couples who desire to use this technology to plan their families. \n Another concern is the use of this technology for nongenetic disorders such as gender selection.  \n Can Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) be used for gender selection?",

        "question": "A hearing screening program was performed to determine the prevalence of hearing loss and abnormal tympanometry in individuals with short-stature skeletal dysplasias attending a national meeting. Behavioral audiometry, otoacoustic emission testing, and tympanometry were used to assess hearing. Failed hearing screen was defined as hearing \u2265 35 dB at one or more frequencies or by \"fail\" on otoacoustic emissions. One hundred ten of 112 subjects completed the screening. 58 (51.8%) were children. Seventy-three (65.2%) had achondroplasia, 34 (30.4%) had one of 11 other diagnoses, and 5(4.4%) were undiagnosed. 25.8% of children failed hearing screening in one or both ears, while 46.3% of adults failed in one or both ears. 55.1% of adults and 25.0% of children with achondroplasia failed screening. \n Forty-four children had achondroplasia, and 31 had normal hearing in both ears (71%); 8 failed hearing screening in 1 ear (18%), and 3 in both ears (7%). Tympanometry was performed in 45 children, with normal tympanograms found in 21 (47%), bilateral abnormal tympanograms in 15 (33%), and unilateral abnormal tympanograms in 9 (20%). Fourteen children with achondroplasia had normal tympanograms (42%); 11 had bilateral abnormal tympanograms (33%); and 8 had unilateral abnormal tympanograms (24%). For those children without functioning tympanostomy tubes, there was a 9.5 times greater odds of hearing loss if there was abnormal tympanometry (P\u00a0=\u00a0.03). \n Achondroplasia (MIM 100800) is the most common non-lethal skeletal dysplasia. Its incidence is between one in 10,000 and one in 30,000. The phenotype is characterized by rhizomelic disproportionate short stature, enlarged head, midface hypoplasia, short hands and lordotic lumbar spine, associated with normal cognitive development. This autosomal-dominant disorder is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the type 3 receptor for fibroblast growth factor (FGFR3); in more than 95% of cases, the mutation is G380R. The diagnosis is suspected on physical examination and confirmed by different age-related radiological features. Anticipatory and management care by a multidisciplinary team will prevent and treat complications, including cervical cord compression, conductive hearing loss and thoracolumbar gibbosity. \n The report includes information on otitis media, ventilation tubes, hearing loss, tonsillectomy, speech problems, tibial bowing and osteotomy, ventricular shunting, apnoea, cervicomedullary decompression, and neurological signs attributable to spinal stenosis. \n We conclude that verbal comprehension is significantly impaired in children with achondroplasia. This partial deficiency is probably related to frequent middle ear infections and resulting conductive hearing loss. \n In order to determine whether these morphologic changes are the cause of the hearing deficit in achondroplasia, audiometric studies and ENT evaluation were performed in eight of the nine patients. \n Audiograms were obtained in six of the nine achondroplastic subjects (two adults and four children). There was evidence of mixed hearing loss in the four children, but only of sensorineural hearing loss in the adults. We believe that the persistent hearing loss in achondroplasia is not due to sequelae of otitis media as some authors have suggested.  \n The AA report a clinical and radiological study performed in 18 achondroplastic patients in order to achieve a nosological settlement of the otological impairments.  \n Is Achondroplasia associated with hearing loss?",

Two siblings died suddenly at the ages of 9 and 10 years, and another two were resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with documented VF at age 10 and 16, respectively. Exome sequencing identified a missense mutation affecting a highly conserved residue (p.Phe90Leu) in the CALM1 gene encoding calmodulin. This mutation was also carried by one of the sibs who died suddenly, for whom DNA was available. The mutation was present in the mother and in an sibling, both asymptomatic but displaying a marginally prolonged QT-interval during exercise. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a mutation in CALM1 underlying IVF manifesting in childhood and adolescence. The causality of the mutation is supported by previous studies demonstrating that Phe90 mediates the direct interaction of CaM with target peptides \n Here we show that calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca2+-sensing protein, binds to the carboxy-terminal 'IQ' domain of the human cardiac Na channel (hH1) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This binding interaction significantly enhances slow inactivation-a channel-gating process linked to life-threatening idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias. Mutations targeted to the IQ domain disrupted CaM binding and eliminated Ca2+/CaM-dependent slow inactivation, whereas the gating effects of Ca2+/CaM were restored by intracellular application of a peptide modelled after the IQ domain.  \n Can mutations in Calmodulin cause ventricular fibrillation?",

Our case adds further information about genotype-phenotype correlation and supports the hypothesis that SNORD116 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome \n These results demonstrate that the AS candidate drug topotecan acts predominantly through stabilizing R loops and chromatin decondensation at the paternally expressed PWS Snord116 locus. Our study holds promise for targeted therapies to the Snord116 locus for both AS and PWS. \n Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the loss of RNA expression from an imprinted region on chromosome 15 that includes SNRPN, SNORD115, and SNORD116.  \n Recently published data strongly suggest a role for the paternally expressed small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) cluster, SNORD116, in PWS etiology. \n Whereas loss of function of the SNORD116 genes appears to be responsible for the major features of PWS, the role of the other genes is less clear.  \n Recent data suggest that snoRNA Snord116 is important for the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) characterized by hyperphagia and obesity. The current study was conducted to assess a potential cellular link between Snord116 and phenotypes of PWS.  \n The imprinted Snurf-Snrpn chromosomal domain contains two large arrays of tandemly repeated, paternally expressed box C/D small-nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes: the SNORD115 (H/MBII-52) and SNORD116 (H/MBII-85) gene clusters believed to play key roles in the fine-tuning of serotonin receptor (5-HT2C) pre-mRNA processing and in the etiology of the Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), respectively \n There are multiple imprinted genes in this region, the loss of which contribute to the complete phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome.

K201 not only controls intracellular calcium release by the ryanodine receptors, but also possesses a ventricular action that might predispose to torsade de pointes arrhythmias.  \n The RyR is currently used as a therapeutic target in malignant hyperthermia where dantrolene is effective and to relieve ventricular arrhythmia, with the use of JTV519 and flecainide. \n Finally, KN-3 and JTV519, two compounds that stabilize RyR2 in the closed state, prevent the induction of triggered activity and suppress the inducibility of sustained AF.  \n JTV-519 greatly reduced the frequency of ouabain-induced arrhythmogenic events. \n Stabilization of RyR2 by JTV-519 effectively reduces these triggered arrhythmias. \n These findings may reveal the anti-arrhythmic potential of K201. \n The preferential ryanodine receptor stabilizer (K201) possesses antiarrhythmic effects through calcium regulation.  \n The drug K201 (JTV-519) increases inotropy and suppresses arrhythmias in failing hearts, but the effects of K201 on normal hearts is unknown.  \n K201 fails to prevent DADs in RyR2(R4496C+/-) myocytes and ventricular arrhythmias in RyR2(R4496C+/-) mice \n In vivo administration of K201 failed to prevent induction of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in RyR2(R4496C+/-) mice. \n The 1,4-benzothiazepine JTV519, which increases the binding affinity of calstabin-2 for RyR2, inhibited the diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, monophasic action potential alternans and triggered arrhythmias. \n In arrhythmias, the calstabin2 stabiliser JTV519 did not prevent arrhythmias in calstabin2-/- mice, but reduced the arrhythmias in calstabin2+/- mice, illustrating the antiarrhythmic potential of stabilising calstablin2.  \n In three models of arrhythmias, the calstabin2 stabiliser JTV519 did not prevent arrhythmias in calstabin2(-/-) mice, but reduced the arrhythmias in calstabin2(+/-) mice, illustrating the antiarrhythmic potential of stabilising calstabin2.  \n A derivative of 1,4-benzothiazepine (JTV519) increased the affinity of calstabin2 for RyR2, which stabilized the closed state of RyR2 and prevented the Ca2+ leak that triggers arrhythmias.  \n JTV-519 had significant protective effects on atrial fibrillation in the canine sterile pericarditis model, mainly by increasing effective refractory period, suggesting that it may have potential as a novel antiarrhythmic agent for atrial fibrillation. \n JTV-519 significantly decreased the mean number of sustained atrial fibrillation episodes (from 4.2 +/- 2.9 to 0 +/- 0, P < 0.01).  \n We conclude that JTV-519 can exert antiarrhythmic effects against AF by inhibiting repolarizing K(+) currents. The drug may be useful for the treatment of AF in patients with ischaemic heart disease. \n Is JTV519 (K201) a potential drug for the prevention of arrhythmias?",

        "question": "The aim of this brief paper is to highlight new developments in understanding the cardioprotective role of thyroid hormone in reverting regulatory networks involved in adverse cardiac remodeling. \n Thyroid hormone receptor \u03b11 (TR\u03b11) is shown to be critical for the maturation of cardiomyocytes and for the cellular response to stress. TR\u03b11 is altered during post ischemic cardiac remodeling but the physiological significance of this response is not fully understood.  \n AMI induces downregulation of thyroid hormone signaling and pharmacological inhibition of TR\u03b11 further depresses post-ischemic cardiac function. \n These findings reveal crucial roles for Dio3 in heart function and remodeling, which may have pathophysiologic implications for human restrictive cardiomyopathy. \n TH administration after AMI prevented tissue hypothyroidism and resulted in decreased beta-MHC expression, increased wall thickening and normalized wallstress, while stretch-induced p38 MAPK activation was increased. We conclude that diabetes exacerbates post-ischemic cardiac remodeling and that tissue hypothyroidism may be involved in this response. \n Thyroid hormone can favorably remodel the diabetic myocardium after acute myocardial infarction. \n It has been previously shown that regulators of physiological growth such as thyroid hormone (TH) can favorably remodel the post ischaemic myocardium. \n Acute myocardial infarction in diabetic rats results in TH receptor down-regulation with important physiological consequences. TH treatment prevents this response and improves cardiac hemodynamics. \n TH affects cardiac remodeling by limiting reperfusion injury, and, at later states, by inducing distinct changes in cardiac chamber geometry in a time-dependent manner. \n Furthermore, administration of TH can convert pathologic to physiologic hypertrophy. These effects are the result of favorable cellular remodeling. \n Thyroid hormone (TH) is critical in cardiac cell differentiation (regulating contractile proteins and cell geometry) and this effect could be potentially exploited therapeutically in reversing the process of de-differentiation which underlies postischemic cardiac remodeling.  \n TH treatment partially reverses cardiac dysfunction in rats with old myocardial infarction by favorably changing cardiac chamber geometry and expression of myosin isoforms. Thyroid hormone, unlike current treatments, appears to be a paradigm of therapeutic intervention which aims at restoring cardiac geometry and may prove new effective treatment for heart failure. \n Changes in thyroid hormone (TH)-TH receptors (TRs) axis occur in the course of post-infarction cardiac remodeling and seem to contribute to cardiac fetal phenotype. TH can \"rebuild\" the post-infarcted heart by preventing the fetal-like pattern of contractile proteins expression, normalizing wall tension, and optimizing cardiac chamber geometry.  \n TH, apart from its \"classical\" actions on cardiac contractility and heart rhythm, appears to regulate various intracellular signaling pathways related to stress responses and cardiac remodelling. \n More importantly, experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that TH can limit ischaemic injury, attenuate cardiac remodeling and improve cardiac hemodynamics.  \n Thyroid hormone attenuates cardiac remodeling and improves hemodynamics early after acute myocardial infarction in rats. \n Thyroid hormone administration early after infarction attenuates cardiac remodeling and significantly improves myocardial performance. \n It has previously been shown that thyroid hormone can reverse cardiac remodeling in failing hearts by reducing myocardial wall stress due to the unique changes induced in cardiac myocyte shape.  \n Increasing evidence indicates that the low TH is not simply a consequence of cardiac disease evolution but a permissive state that favours adverse cardiac remodeling and failure.\nAs summarized in Figure 1, restoration of a normal TH profile might counteract the progression of adverse cardiac remodeling by (1) inhibiting CM death pathways, (2) reducing fibrous tissue deposition, (3) improving myocardial perfusion, and (4) preventing pathological cardiac hypertrophy. \n Does thyroid hormone affect cardiac remodeling?",

        "question": "In 1999, proof-of-concept for treating these disorders was obtained in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy, when administration of aminoglycosides restored protein translation by inducing the ribosome to bypass a PTC. \n xpression of retroviral replication enzymes (Pol) requires a controlled translational recoding event to bypass the stop codon at the end of gag. This recoding event occurs either by direct suppression of termination via the insertion of an amino acid at the stop codon (readthrough) or by alteration of the mRNA reading frame (frameshift). \n Aminoglycosides have the capability to mediate a bypass of stop mutations during translation thus resulting in a rescue of protein expression. \n The underlying molecular pathology in a considerable proportion of these diseases however are nonsense mutations leading to premature termination codons. \n We have taken advantage of the ability of aminoglycoside drugs to suppress such nonsense mutations and partially restore full-length, functional protein in a zebrafish model of choroideraemia (chm(ru848); juvenile chorio-retinal degeneration) and in two models of ocular coloboma (noi(tu29a) and gup(m189); congenital optic fissure closure defects). \n This is the first demonstration that the LTR promoter directs Tca2 pol protein expression, and that pol proteins are translated from a gag-pol RNA, which thus requires a mechanism for stop codon bypass. \n In the C. albicans retrotransposon Tca2, the gag and pol ORFs are separated by a UGA stop codon, 3' of which is a potential RNA pseudoknot. It is unclear how the Tca2 gag UGA codon is bypassed to allow pol expression. \n Aminoglycosides can bypass nonsense mutations and are the prototypic agents for translational bypass therapy (TBT). \n Recent studies on translation termination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have not only enabled the identification of the key components of the termination machinery, but have also revealed several regulatory mechanisms that might enable the controlled synthesis of C-terminally extended polypeptides via stop-codon readthrough. \n These retroelements have a conserved stem-loop at the end of gag, and likely express pol either by a novel means of internal ribosomal entry or by a bypass mechanism. \n Among the 58 SORFs identified, eight displayed a stop codon bypass level ranging from 3 to 25%. For each of the eight sequences, we demonstrated the presence of a poly(A) mRNA. \n Our results demonstrate that the presence of a stop codon in a large ORF may not always correspond to a sequencing error, or a pseudogene, but can be a recoding signal in a functional gene. \n This study demonstrates that in nondividing Escherichia coli cells, a DNA template base replaced with uracil in a stop codon in the firefly luciferase gene results in conversion of inactive to active luciferase. \n Phenotypic change caused by transcriptional bypass of uracil in nondividing cells. \n These results suggest that in tomato tissues, GPR is made as part of a longer polypeptide by some translational mechanism that enables bypass of the internal stop codon, such as frameshifting or ribosome hopping. \n Translation of yeast GCN4 mRNA occurs by a reinitiation mechanism that is modulated by amino acid levels in the cell. Ribosomes which translate the first of four upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the mRNA leader resume scanning and can reinitiate downstream. \n Expression of the RNA replicase domain of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and certain protein-coding regions in other plant viruses, is mediated by translational readthrough of a leaky UAG stop codon. \n Our studies demonstrate a major role for the 3' context in the read through process and do not support a model in which teh UAG is bypassed exclusively as a result of anticodon-codon interactions. \n A translational frameshift is necessary in the synthesis of Escherichia coli release factor 2 (RF-2) to bypass an in-frame termination codon within the coding sequence. \n Plant RNA viruses commonly exploit leaky translation termination signals in order to express internal protein coding regions. \n These studies indicated that ribosomes bypass the leaky termination sites at efficiencies ranging from essentially 0 to ca. 5% depending upon the viral sequence. \n A translational frameshift is necessary in the synthesis of Escherichia coli release factor 2 (RF-2) to bypass an in-frame termination codon within the coding sequence. \n These results show that in vitro on eukaryotic ribosomes where the Shine-Dalgarno-type interaction is not possible, high efficiency frameshifting around the in-phase stop codon in the RF-2 mRNA can still occur. \n pol protein expression is mediated by a non-canonical stop codon bypass mechanism \n in this organism, pol proteins are translated from a gag-pol RNA using a novel mechanism for stop codon bypass \n Is stop codon bypass possible?",

These compounds act via Hedgehog, Insulin-like growth factor or Transforming growth factor \u03b2 signaling pathways.  \n Here, we report that the balance between the reparative and regenerative processes is achieved through Smad3-dependent TGF\u03b2 signaling.  \n Thus, TGF\u03b2 signaling orchestrates the beneficial interplay between scar-based repair and cardiomyocyte-based regeneration to achieve complete heart regeneration. \n As expected, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, a profibrotic cytokine, was dramatically upregulated in MI hearts, but its phosphorylated comediator (pSmad) was significantly downregulated in the nuclei of Cx43-deficient hearts post-MI, suggesting that downstream signaling of TGF-beta is diminished substantially in Cx43-deficient hearts. This diminution in profibrotic TGF-beta signaling resulted in the attenuation of adverse structural remodeling as assessed by echocardiography. \n Potentially beneficial changes include increases in the HSMP secretory-leucocyte-protease-inhibitor (SLPI) and cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1). Targeting these proteins may mitigate enhanced LV remodeling and dysfunction with aging. \n After injury, the presence of macrophages, which secreted high levels of transforming growth factor-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor-A, led to rapid removal of cell debris and replacement by granulation tissue containing inflammatory cells and blood vessels, followed by myofibroblast infiltration and collagen deposition. \n Secretion of transforming growth factor-beta and vascular endothelial growth factor-A as well as neovascularization, myofibroblast infiltration, and collagen deposition decreased.  \n Repression of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine synthesis, mediated in part through Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-beta and Interleukin (IL)-10, is critical for resolution of the inflammatory infiltrate and transition to fibrous tissue deposition. \n TGF-beta conducted the myogenic differentiation of CD117+ stem cells by upregulating GATA-4 and NKx-2.5 expression. Therefore, the intramyocardial implantation of TGF-beta-preprogrammed CD117+ cells effectively assisted the myocardial regeneration and induced therapeutic angiogenesis, contributing to functional cardiac regeneration. \n These results indicate that TGF-beta/Smad signaling may be involved in the remodeling of the infarct scar after the completion of wound healing per se, via ongoing stimulation of matrix deposition. \n Does TGF-beta play a role in cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction?",

Recent markers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and podocin have garnered a lot of attention. The emergence of these and other biomarkers is largely because of the evolution of novel genomic and proteomic applications in investigations of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease. \n For decades, the rise in serum creatinine has been the only detectable sign of a reduction in glomerular filtration \n Labile iron is also believed to play an essential role in the oxidative organ damage of AKI \n NGAL seems to be one of the earliest kidney markers of ischemic or nephrotoxic injury in animal models, and it may be detected in the blood and urine of humans soon after AKI \n in intensive care adult patients with AKI secondary to sepsis, ischemia, or nephrotoxins, NGAL is significantly increased in the plasma and urine when compared to normal controls \n In AKI, urinary excretion of cystatin C has been shown to predict the requirement for renal replacement therapy earlier than creatinine. \n KIM-1 is measurable in the urine after ischemic or nephrotoxic insults to proximal tubular cells \n Urinary KIM-1 seems to be highly specific for AKI due to systemic illnesses such as sepsis and not for prerenal azotemia or drug-induced renal injury \n Importantly, KIM-1 may be elevated before there is histologic evidence of proximal tubular cell death \n NAG has been shown to function as a marker of AKI, reflecting particularly the degree of tubular damage \n Interleukin-18 (IL-18)IL-18 is a proinflammatory cytokine detected in the urine after acute ischemic proximal tubular damage [81].

Several other genes, including PTPN22 and PADI4, show modest association with RA.  \n Several alleles in the epitope-recognition part of the HLA molecule that show the highest association with RA susceptibility, also share a common string of amminoacid residues (the so-called shared-epitope hypothesis). Other variants in potentially pathogenic genes located in non-MHC regions have been implicated by recently performed genome wide analysis studies. These genes include PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, PADI4, STAT4.  \n n particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided supportive evidence that RA is a disease with a strong genetic background. Interestingly, a series of candidate genes have been identified outside of the classical major histocompatibility (MHC) locus, which had long been regarded as the major contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role. \n ssociation of the PTPN22 gene (-1123G > C) polymorphism with rheumatoid arthritis in Chinese patients \n Eight markers (ie, rs1160542 (AFF3), rs1678542 (KIF5A), rs2476601 (PTPN22), rs3087243 (CTLA4), rs4810485 (CD40), rs5029937 (6q23), rs10760130 (TRAF1/C5) and rs7574865 (STAT4)) were significantly associated with RA by meta-analysis \n Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on RA identified known and novel susceptibility genes like HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, TRAF1/C5, OLIG3/TNFAIP3, CD40, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, IL2RB, and KIF5A-PIP4K2C.  \n This study investigated five confirmed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility genes/loci (HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5) for association with susceptibility and severity in an inception cohort \n After initial completion of the Human Genome Project on the 16th February 2001, significant progress has been made in identifying other than HLA genome regions linked to the increased RA susceptibility. As an effect several new genes have been recognized as an HLA-independent genetic risk factors of RA. PTPN22 gene polymorphism, C5/TRAF1 genes region polymorphism and TNFAIP3-OLIG3 genes region polymorphism(s) are among newly identified and already confirmed genetic risk factors \n As well as the major susceptibility gene HLA-DRB1, recent genome-wide and candidate-gene studies reported additional evidence for association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5 loci with RA. \n Recent advances have led to novel identification of genetic polymorphisms that are associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Currently, 5 loci (HLA, PTPN22, TRAF1/C5, TNFAIP3, and STAT4) have been consistently reported, whereas others have been observed less systematically \n However, inconsistent results of the contributions of non-HLA susceptibility genes have been described, with the exception of a few genes repeatedly associated with RA-susceptibility, such as PTPN22 gene in populations of European ancestry and PADI4 gene in populations of Asian ancestry, revealing the presence of genetic heterogeneity in RA.  \n In conclusion, we have confirmed that PTPN22 620W allele is associated with Tunisian RA but does not constitute a factor influencing clinical manifestations.  \n After adjusting for smoking and reproductive factors, PTPN22 was associated with RA risk among Caucasian women in these cohorts \n We found strong evidence of an association of PTPN22 with the development of anti-citrulline antibody-positive RA (odds ratio [OR] 1.49; P=.00002), using previously untested EIRA samples. \n Although HLA-DRB1 is the main RA gene, it accounts for only part of the familial risk for RA. HLA-DRB1 alleles are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause the development of RA in a given individual.

More recently, the understanding of non-structural causes such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome has grown and diagnostic criteria have been developed.  \n This review considers in particular the causes of death affecting athletes below 35 years of age. In this age group the largest proportion of deaths are caused by diseases with autosomal dominant inheritance such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT-syndrome, and Marfan's syndrome.  \n Knowledge of sudden cardiac death in young athletes is imperative for all physicians and allied health professionals.  \n In this article, we review several etiologies of sudden cardiac death, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and commotio cordis.  \n Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes is generally caused by inherited cardiac disorders. \n The genetic abnormalities most associated with SCD are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. \n The most common cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Other reasons are congenital coronary artery anomalies, nivocarditis, dilatative cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the right ventricle, sarcoidosis, mitral valve prolapse, aortic valve stenosis, atherosclerosis, long QT syndrome, and blunt impact to the chest. \n The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is caused by cardiac ion channel mutations, which predispose young individuals to sudden cardiac death often related to exercise.  \n A group of relatively uncommon but important genetic cardiovascular diseases (GCVDs) are associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death during exercise, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long-QT syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. \n Primary electrical disorders (such as the long QT syndrome) are rarely present in athletes but, so far, are a considerable reason for disqualification from sport activity.  \n For example, in young athletes (younger than 35 years) the vast majority of sudden deaths are due to underlying cardiovascular abnormalities including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital coronary anomalies and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). These deaths occur most commonly in team sports such as basketball and football, which have the highest levels of participation[8, 23, 24].\nTo a lesser extent, other abnormalities including dilated cardiomyopathy, aortic rupture in the context of Marfan syndrome, myocarditis, valvular disease (aortic stenosis, mitral valve prolapse) and electrical disorders (Wolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome), as well as commotio cordis (malignant arrhythmia due to blunt chest trauma) are responsible \n LQTS may manifest as palpitation, presyncope, syncope, seizure, cardiac arrest and/or SCD in young individuals and is often associated with exercise \n Is long QT syndrome a cause for sudden cardiac death in athletes?",

        "question": "Amplification of MET has been reported in approximately 5%-22% of lung tumors with acquired resistance to small-molecule inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Resistance to EGFR inhibitors is likely mediated through downstream activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase /AKT pathway. \n Simultaneous treatment of resistant tumors with a MET inhibitor plus an EGFR inhibitor can abrogate activation of downstream effectors of cell growth, proliferation, and survival, thereby overcoming acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors. \n HGF mediated both ERK and Akt phosphorylation. \n ERK/Akt signaling, but not the Smad pathway, may be one of the main processes in HGF-induced EMT, \n The MAPK/Akt pathway is indispensable in HGF/c-Met signaling. \n Inhibition of c-Met activation sensitizes osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin via suppression of the PI3K-Akt signaling \n Specifically, we demonstrated that inhibition of c-Met activity led to suppression of the PI3K-Akt pathway, thus enhancing cisplatin chemosensitivity. \n Our study clearly suggests that inhibition of c-Met activity can effectively sensitize osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin via suppression of the PI3K-Akt signaling. \n We found that a dual Met/VEGF receptor 2 kinase inhibitor, E7050, circumvented HGF-induced EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines by inhibiting the Met/Gab1/PI3K/Akt pathway in vitro. \n Here, we report that i) treatment of RL95-2 cells with HGF resulted in phosphorylation of the HGF receptor c-Met, activation of Akt and I\u03baB, translocation of NF-\u03baB into the nucleus, and up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA; \n Our data suggest that HGF possesses chemotactic ability, has anti-apoptosis action, and induces cellular infiltration via the PI3K/Akt pathway; \n Hepatocyte growth factor-induced c-Src-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway inhibits dendritic cell activation by blocking I\u03baB kinase activity \n Activation of c-Src in turn establishes a complex consisting of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and c-MET, and promotes downstream activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and mammalian target of rapamycin. \n Notably, hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated c-Src activation results in induction of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes p85\u03b1/p110\u03b1 and p85\u03b1/p110\u03b4, which is required for activation of mammalian target of rapamycin, and consequent inhibition of I\u03baB kinase and nuclear factor-\u03baB activation. \n Our findings, for the first time, have identified the c-Src-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway that plays a pivotal role in mediating the inhibitory effects of hepatocyte growth factor on dendritic cell activation by blocking nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling. \n Cyr61 siRNA inhibited a second phase of Akt phosphorylation measured 12 hours after cell stimulation with HGF and also inhibited HGF-induced phosphorylation of the Akt target glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha. \n HGF+EGF treatment increased the duration of ERK1/2 and AKT activation compared to HGF or EGF alone. All these data indicate that a crosstalk between the EGF and HGF pathways in mammary epithelial cells may modulate the development of the mammary gland. \n Hepatocyte growth factor and c-Met promote dendritic maturation during hippocampal neuron differentiation via the Akt pathway \n Consistent with these results, HGF activated Akt, which phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) to inactivate it, and reduced phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), which can promote microtubule polymerization and dendrite elongation when dephosphorylated. \n Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of c-Met with its specific inhibitor, PHA-665752, or genetic knock-down of c-Met with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) suppressed HGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta, increased phosphorylation of MAP2, and reduced dendrite number and length in cultured hippocampal neurons. \n Inhibiting Akt activity with the phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or Akt inhibitor X suppressed HGF-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, increased MAP2 phosphorylation, and blocked the ability of HGF to enhance dendritic length. \n These observations indicate that HGF and c-Met can regulate the early stages of dendrite maturation via activation of the Akt/GSK-3beta pathway. \n Involvement of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in hepatocyte growth factor-induced migration of uveal melanoma cells \n HGF was found to enhance cell migration, and that HGF-induced migration depends on PI3K/Akt pathway. The activation of PI3K/Akt pathway induced by the HGF/c-Met axis is involved in the downregulation of cell adhesion molecules E-cadherin and beta-catenin, contributing to the attenuation of cell-cell adhesion and promoting the enhanced motility and migration of uveal melanoma cells. \n HGF protects cultured cortical neurons against hypoxia/reoxygenation induced cell injury via ERK1/2 and PI-3K/Akt pathways \n HGF stimulated both ERK1/2 and Akt activities in cortical neurons. \n Inhibition of ERK activation completely abolished the protective effects of HGF, and inhibition of Akt activation reduced, but did not completely eliminate the HGF mediated neuroprotection. \n It is suggested that the neuroprotection of HGF depend on ERK1/2 pathway, and, to a lesser extent, PI-3K/Akt pathway.  \n Met signals hepatocyte survival by preventing Fas-triggered FLIP degradation in a PI3k-Akt-dependent manner \n Thus, Met acting on PI3K and Akt ensures high levels of FLIPL, and disruption of this pathway contributes to hepatic apoptosis and possibly to Fas-related liver diseases. \n The HGF-induced increase in Nkx 2.5 expression was inhibited by co-treatment with the PI3 kinase inhibitors Wortmannin and LY294002, but not by its inactive homolog LY303511, suggesting an involvement of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway in this effect. \n X-Linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression level in colorectal cancer is regulated by hepatocyte growth factor/C-met pathway via Akt signaling \n Activation of XIAP expression by HGF was inhibited by siRNA targeting Akt1 and Akt2. \n Activation of C-MET enhances XIAP through the Akt pathway. \n Hepatocyte growth factor prevents ventricular remodeling and dysfunction in mice via Akt pathway and angiogenesis \n A significant reduction in apoptosis in the HGF-treated hearts was observed compared with control hearts, and was strongly associated with increased Akt activation. \n The antiapoptotic effect of HGF was mediated by activation of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway. \n The protective effect of HGF/SF against the ADR-induced apoptosis was abolished in the presence of either LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3'-OH kinase (PI3-K) or 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate, an inhibitor of Akt, thus implicating the activation of PI3-K-Akt signaling in the antiapoptotic action of HGF/SF. \n Immunoblotting analysis revealed that HGF/SF stimulated the sustained phosphorylation of Akt for several hours \n Furthermore, ADR-induced activation of caspase-9, a downstream molecule of Akt, was inhibited for at least 24 h after HGF/SF stimulation, \n These results indicate that HGF/SF, but not EGF, transmitted protective signals against ADR-induced apoptosis by causing sustained activation of the PI3-K-Akt signaling pathway. \n Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor inhibits UVB-induced apoptosis of human keratinocytes but not of keratinocyte-derived cell lines via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway \n When we analyzed the signaling pathways initiated by the HGF/SF receptor c-met, we found that the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and its downstream-element AKT and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase were activated. \n Inhibition of PI 3-kinase led to a complete abrogation of the anti-apoptotic effect of HGF/SF, whereas blockade of the MAP kinase pathway had no effect. \n We now show in detached cells a cooperative effect of HGF and FN in the activation of PI 3-kinase and on the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at serine 473. \n PI 3-kinase activity is also required for the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival responses, as well as anchorage-independent colony growth. \n Together, these results demonstrate that the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway is a key effector of the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival response of breast carcinoma cells under detached conditions and corroborate an interaction between integrin and HGF/ Met signalling pathways in the development of invasive breast cancer. \n Is c-met involved in the activation of the Akt pathway?",

        "question": "Among these syndromes, relevant advances have recently been made in Werner syndrome, one of several progeroid syndromes characterized by defective DNA helicases, \n Progeroid syndromes (PSs) constitute a group of disorders characterized by clinical features mimicking physiological aging at an early age. \n However, all the characterized PSs enter in the field of rare monogenic disorders and several causative genes have been identified. These can be separated in subcategories corresponding to (i) genes encoding DNA repair factors, in particular, DNA helicases, and (ii) genes affecting the structure or post-translational maturation of lamin A, a major nuclear component. \n None of the known progerias represents true precocious ageing. Some of them, including Werner (WS), Bloom (BS), and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes (RTS) as well as combined xeroderma pigmentosa-Cockayne syndrome (XP-CS) are characterised by features resembling precocious ageing and the increased risk of malignant disease. Such phenotypes result from the mutations of the genes encoding proteins involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity, in most cases DNA helicases. \n Single-gene mutations can produce human progeroid syndromes--phenotypes that mimic usual or \"normative\" aging. \n The prototypic example of the former is the Werner syndrome, a condition caused by mutations of the RecQ family of DNA helicases. \n Progeria and progeroid syndromes are characterized by the earlier onset of complex senescent phenotypes.

        "question": "Our data demonstrate that engaging Wnt signaling at the receptor level by this method leads to necessary crosstalk between multiple signaling pathways including activation of Akt, mTOR, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, PKA/CREB, and inhibition of RhoA/ROCK that substantially increase human \u03b2-cell proliferation while maintaining the \u03b2-cell phenotype. \n The cross-talk role of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, with GSK-3\u03b2 as the key enzyme bridging these pathways, may contribute to the inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma cells by hUC-MSCs. \n We find that Wnt stimulation leads to phosphorylation of insulin signaling key mediators, including Akt, GSK3\u03b2, and ERK1/2, although with a lower fold stimulation and slower time course than observed for insulin. \n Wnt induces phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and GSK3\u03b2, and this is dependent on insulin/IGF-1 receptors. \n Pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K resulted in the downregulation of several members of the \u03b2-catenin pathway, including Fra-1, c-Myc, and cyclin D1. \n Similar results were observed in vivo, as intratumoral injection of LY294002 downregulated the expression of the components of the \u03b2-catenin pathway and delayed tumor growth in nude mice harboring subcutaneous LN229 xenografts. \n These results suggest that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway regulates glioma cell proliferation, in part via repression of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. \n Small-molecule inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin pathway cross-talk and suppress medulloblastoma growth \n Small-molecule inhibitors targeting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway affected beta-catenin signaling by activation [corrected] of GSK-3beta, [corrected] resulting in cytoplasmic retention of beta-catenin and reduced expression of its target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc. \n These findings demonstrate the importance of cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and beta-catenin pathways in medulloblastoma and rationalize the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in treatment of this disease. \n Western blot analyses revealed that the recombinant Wnt ligand Wnt-3A increased phosphorylation of AKT and the downstream kinase glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta as well as accumulation of activated, nuclear beta-catenin. \n Chemical inhibition of PI3K abolished Wnt-dependent phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3beta and trophoblast motility but did not affect appearance of activated beta-catenin or Wnt/TCF reporter activity. \n The data suggest that Wnt-3A may activate canonical Wnt signaling and PI3K/AKT through distinct receptors. \n Mutational activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway occurs in a wide variety of tumors, whereas activating Wnt pathway mutants are predominantly found in colon cancer. Because GSK3 is a key component of both pathways, it is widely assumed that active PI3K signaling feeds positively into the Wnt pathway by protein kinase B (PKB)-mediatefd inhibition of GSK3. \n n addition, PKB has been proposed to modulate the canonical Wnt signaling through direct stabilization and nuclear localization of beta-catenin. \n Here, we show that compartmentalization by Axin of GSK3 prohibits cross-talk between the PI3K and Wnt pathways and that Wnt-mediated transcriptional activity is not modulated by activation of the PI3K/PKB pathway. \n Our recent study revealed a second mechanism for Cby-mediated beta-catenin inhibition in which Cby cooperates with 14-3-3 adaptor proteins to facilitate nuclear export of beta-catenin, following phosphorylation of Cby by Akt kinase. \n Therefore, our findings unravel a novel molecular mechanism regulating the dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of beta-catenin and provide new insights into the cross-talk between the Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. \n Here, we review recent literature concerning Cby function and discuss our current understanding of the relationship between Wnt and Akt signaling. \n As inappropriate activation of WNT/CTNNB1 signaling causes late-onset GCT development and cross talk between the PI3K/AKT and WNT/CTNNB1 pathways has been reported, we tested whether these pathways could synergize in GCT. \n This explains why prostate tumors subjected to androgen ablation experience an increase in Akt phosphorylation, and suggest that the tumor compensates for the loss of one pathway with another. Different modes of interaction between the two pathways, including direct interaction, or regulation via downstream intermediates, such as the wnt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin pathway, NF-kappaB, and the FOXO family of transcription factors, will be discussed. \n FGF signals are transduced through FGF receptor to the FRS2-GRB2-GAB1-PI3K-AKT signaling cascade to downregulate GSK3beta activity depending on Ser 9 phosphorylation. Because GSK3beta-dependent phosphorylation of beta-catenin and SNAIL leads to FBXW1 (betaTRCP)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, GSK3beta downregulation results in the stabilization and the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and SNAIL. \n Bridging the BMP and Wnt pathways by PI3 kinase/Akt and 14-3-3zeta \n Concurrently, PTEN, an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt pathway, is also primarily inactivated in the ISCs, leading to activation of Akt. Thus, Akt may contribute to activation of beta-catenin in ISCs in coordination with Wnt signaling. \n Thus, we propose that BMP signaling plays a role in inhibition of ISC self-renewal through suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in ISC, and this cross-talk is bridged, at least in part, through the PTEN/Akt pathway and further enforced by 14-3-3zeta. \n In MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cultures, dexamethasone (DEX) activates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) and inhibits a differentiation-related cell cycle that occurs at a commitment stage immediately after confluence. \n Here we show that DEX inhibition of the differentiation-related cell cycle is associated with a decrease in beta-catenin levels and inhibition of LEF/TCF-mediated transcription. \n These inhibitory activities are no longer observed in the presence of lithium, a GSK3beta inhibitor. \n DEX decreased the serum-responsive phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt-Ser(473) within minutes, and this inhibition was also observed after 12 h. When the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway was inhibited by wortmannin, DEX no longer inhibited beta-catenin levels. \n Furthermore, DEX-mediated inhibition of LEF/TCF transcriptional activity was attenuated in the presence of dominant negative forms of either PI3K or protein kinase B/Akt. These results suggest cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways. \n These results suggest that inhibition of a PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta/beta-catenin/LEF axis and stimulation of HDAC1 cooperate to mediate the inhibitory effect of DEX on Wnt signaling and the osteoblast differentiation-related cell cycle. \n WISP-1 (Wnt-1-induced secreted protein) was identified as an oncogene regulated by the Wnt-1-beta-catenin pathway. \n Here it is shown that WISP-1 can activate the antiapoptotic Akt/PKB signaling pathway.  \n Our results show that both TGF\u03b21 and Wnt3a lead to increased accumulation of \u03b2-catenin, phosphorylation of AKT and p44/42 MAPK. \n This novel strategy engages both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling, and in combination with RhoA/ROCK inhibition removes insulin signaling pathway resistance and allows necessary crosstalk between Wnt/GSK-3/\u03b2-catenin, Akt/mTOR, and PKA/CREB pathways associated with human \u03b2-cell regenerative processes. \n activation of Wnt signaling at the level of GSK-3 inhibition by LiCl had no effect on enhancing Akt phosphorylation (lanes 1 vs 2), whereas engaging Wnt signaling at the receptor level with L-WRN or L-WRN+ resulted in significant increases in Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 \n these results suggest that L-WRN+ promotes crosstalk between PKA, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and Akt signaling in human islets to enhance proliferative processes \n L-WRN+ promotes crosstalk between Wnt and PKA/CREB and Akt signaling in human islets \n Non-canonical Wnt pathway activation increases RhoA/ROCK signaling that results in degradation of IRS1/2 and negatively affects Akt phosphorylation \n It has been shown that activated Akt can effectively suppress the role of GSK-3\u03b2 in regulating the degradation of \u03b2-catenin \n GSK-3\u03b2 is a key molecule in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and activated Akt has been shown to effectively suppress the role of GSK-3\u03b2 in regulating the degradation of \u03b2-catenin \n It has been shown that in response to certain growth stimuli, PI3K-activated AKT can phosphorylate GSK-3\u03b2 at Ser9, leading to inactivation of GSK-3\u03b2 and augmentation of \u03b2-catenin-TCF4 transcriptional activity \n We found that conditioned media from hUC-MSCs can affect PI3K/Akt signal transduction through inhibition of PDK1 phosphorylation and inhibit Akt activity resulting in activation of GSK-3\u03b2. This may lead to inhibition of nuclear \u03b2-catenin translocation, which down-regulates the expression of target genes c-Myc and cyclin D1, and induces the apoptosis of HCCC-9810 cells.\nInhibition of nuclear \u03b2-catenin translocation is likely to be due to the observed inhibition of Akt activity by hUC-MSC conditioned media. This, in turn, could have triggered activation of GSK-3\u03b2 function because activated Akt has been shown to effectively suppress GSK-3\u03b2 levels which regulate the degradation of \u03b2-catenin \n Based on our findings, we propose a schematic model of how the hUC-MSC cultures could have affected various molecular events by the cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways, leading to apoptosis in human HCCC-9810 cells (Fig. 8). In this scheme, inhibitory molecules in hUC-MSC conditioned media mediate Akt phosphorylation in HCCC-9810 cells, thereby decreasing phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 and increasing its activity. Activation of GSK-3\u03b2leads to increased degradation of \u03b2-catenin, and decreased cellular \u03b2-catenin levels. A reduction in \u03b2-catenin translocation to the nucleus to bind TCF4, leads to decreased transcription of its specific target genes resulting in apoptosis. \n Proposed model by which hUC-MSC cultures mediates cross-talk between Wnt and Akt signaling in HCCC-9810 cells.Inhibitory molecules in hUC-MSC conditioned media mediate Akt phosphorylation in HCCC-9810 cells, thereby decreasing phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2and increasing its activity.

A decrease in \u03b2-catenin translocation to the nucleus to bind TCF4, and decreases the transcription of its specific target genes resulting in apoptosis. \n The molecular cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways is involved in this inhibitory effect, with GSK-3\u03b2 as the key enzyme bridging these pathways. \n Is there any cross-talk between the Wnt and the Akt pathways?",

However, two facts make this situation complicated: First, the risk of hematoma expansion is unknown for NOACs. Second, there is no specific antidote for neither of the NOACs. \n he new oral anticoagulants dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis) have predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and are alternatives to warfarin. However, many physicians are wary of these drugs, since there is limited evidence on how to manage bleeding in patients taking them, and since no specific antidote is known to reverse their anticoagulant effect.  \n Given the absence of a specific antidote, the action to be taken in these situations must be defined.  \n The fact that there is no specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulant action of the new anticoagulants can impair management of hemorrhagic complications;  \n Like any new therapy, the potential benefits must be weighed against the potential challenges and one of the most concerning aspects of the new target-specific oral anticoagulants is the lack of a proven method to reverse their effect. Unlike the vitamin K antagonist, i.e. warfarin, there is no specific antidote for these medications.  \n Two major drawbacks are on the one hand the risk of drug accumulation in kidney and/or liver disease and, on the other hand, the lack of specific antidotes. \n NOA also have other unresolved problems: drug interactions are still possible, specific coagulation test to assess them must be developed, and no specific antidote is currently available in case of hemorrhagic complication. \n But they have disadvantages also, they depend on renal clearance, they can interact with other medicaments and they lack a specific antidote.  \n While these trial data are extremely encouraging, several practical issues (e.g., lack of specific antidote, safety of long-term treatment or cost-effectiveness in \"real-life\" clinical practice) still need to be elucidated. \n In case of massive bleeding, management is unclear and none of these newer agents has a specific antidote that completely reverses its anticoagulant effect. \n The short half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote in many instances.  \n Currently, none of these new agents has a specific antidote, and little advise can be given on how to manage a major bleeding event. \n Rivaroxaban, which inhibits activated factor X (Xa), is currently in clinical trials and is the most advanced factor Xa inhibitor. The drug offers once-daily oral dosing, with no need for injections, dose titration, or frequent blood tests to monitor the international normalised ratio. It has a rapid onset of action and, although there is no specific antidote, it has a short plasma elimination half-life (about 5-9 hours).  \n Increased use of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban as oral anticoagulants for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and acute deep venous thrombosis has increased despite the lack of known antidotes to these medications. \n There is no antidote for reversal and no reliable laboratory monitoring of the anticoagulant effect for emergency situations.  \n Further concerns about the use of NOAC in the elderly are the high prevalence of renal insufficiency in AF patients >75 years of age, the largely unknown risk of drug-drug and drug-food interactions, the lack of easily available laboratory monitoring tests of anticoagulant activity and the lack of an antidote. \n Specific antidotes for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of these drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies against the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran or recombinant Xa-analog in the case of factor Xa inhibitors, are still being investigated in early clinical trials. \n In early 2013 there is no antidote for dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban, nor any specific treatment with proven efficacy for severe bleeding linked to these drugs.  \n Are there any specific antidotes for rivaroxaban?",

        "question": "We and others have published observational epidemiologic studies in support of vitamins in the primary prevention of CVD, but the results from intervention studies are mixed. \n For vitamin E, observational data suggest benefit at doses of 100 to 400 IU/d. Results from recent large-scale trials are mixed, with some showing modest benefit but others suggesting no benefit, especially for secondary prevention. Results for B vitamins are also mixed and further complicated by the recent folate fortification of the flour supply. If greater B vitamin intake does reduce CVD, the benefits are likely to be greatest for primary prevention and in populations with intake below dietary reference standards.  \n In the dose-response meta-analysis, each 30 mg/day increase in vitamin C, 30 IU/day increase in vitamin E, and 1 mg/day increase in beta-carotene yielded the estimated overall relative risk for CHD of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.99-1.02), 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94-0.99), and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.88-1.14), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in this meta-analysis suggest that an increase in dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins has encouraging prospects for possible CHD prevention. \n High levels of \u03b1-tocopherol in serum were associated with 30% lower CAD risk in another study (HR 0.71; 95%CI 0.53-0.94). Among minerals (zinc, selenium, and chromium), an inverse association between zinc and CAD was observed; levels lower than 14.1 \u00b5mol/L were associated with an increased risk for CAD (RR 1.70; 95%CI 1.21-2.38). \n The information available on this issue is scarce. Further prospective studies are needed to elucidate the role of these nutrients in the cardiovascular risk of patients with diabetes. \n Coenzyme Q10 supplementation at a dosage of 150 mg appears to decrease the inflammatory marker IL-6 in patients with CAD. \n  Coenzyme Q10 supplements at a dose of 150 mg can decrease oxidative stress and increase antioxidant enzyme activity in patients with CAD. A higher dose of coenzyme Q10 supplements (>150 mg/d) might promote rapid and sustainable antioxidation in patients with CAD. \n Alpha-tocopherol or beta-carotene supplementation has no protective effect on macrovascular outcomes or total mortality of diabetic male smokers. \n Sodium selenite supplementation increases GPx-1 activity in endothelial cells and in CAD patients. Future studies have to demonstrate whether long-term CAD outcome can be improved. \n After 7.3 years of treatment and follow-up, a combination pill of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 did not reduce a combined end point of total cardiovascular events among high-risk women, despite significant homocysteine lowering. \n  In this population-based study, vitamin E use was unrelated to mortality, but this apparently null finding seems to represent a combination of increased mortality in those with severe cardiovascular disease and a possible protective effect in those without. \n  In this large cohort of apparently healthy US male physicians, self-selected supplementation with vitamin E, vitamin C, or multivitamins was not associated with a significant decrease in total CVD or CHD mortality.  \n The American Heart Association has recommended consumption of a balanced diet with emphasis on antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables but has made no recommendations regarding vitamin E supplementation for the general population. Although vitamin E supplementation seems to be safe for most people, recommendations from health care professionals should reflect the uncertainty of established benefit as demonstrated in clinical trials \n Recent studies show that supplementation with antioxidant vitamins E and C have benefits in CHD prevention; however, supplementation with beta-carotene may have deleterious effects and is not recommended. Current evidence suggests that patients with CHD would probably benefit from taking vitamin E in a dosage of 400 IU per day and vitamin C in a dosage of 500 to 1,000 mg per day. Clinicians may also want to consider vitamin supplementation for CHD prevention in high-risk patients. Folate lowers elevated homocysteine levels, but evidence for routine supplemental use does not yet exist.  \n In patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, treatment with vitamin E for a mean of 4.5 years had no apparent effect on cardiovascular outcomes. \n Is indicated the use of antioxidant supplements in patients at risk for coronary artery disease?",

Most of these processes occur co-transcriptionally while the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) enzyme is engaged in transcriptional elongation \n A model in vitro system for co-transcriptional splicing \n Abundant evidence indicates that splicing to excise introns occurs co-transcriptionally, prior to release of the nascent transcript from RNAP II \n Together, our work establishes a system for co-transcriptional splicing in vitro, in which the spliceosome containing the 5' and 3' exons are tethered to RNAP II for splicing. \n Co-transcriptional splicing of constitutive and alternative exons \n Current evidence supports co-transcriptional spliceosomal assembly, but there is little quantitative information on how much splicing is completed during RNA synthesis \n Thus, we demonstrate that the decision to include or skip an alternative exon is made during transcription and not post-transcriptionally \n Here, we demonstrated that the co-transcriptional splicing of the intron in vitro was blocked by antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting the P3-P7 core of the intron \n RNA editing and alternative splicing: the importance of co-transcriptional coordination \n Co-transcriptional splicing of pre-messenger RNAs: considerations for the mechanism of alternative splicing \n The realization that splicing occurs co-transcriptionally requires two important considerations \n Subsequently, a number of key studies in several model systems supported the notion that splicing at least begins co-transcriptionally, i.e. on nascent RNA tethered to chromatin by elongating Pol II \n Co-transcriptional splicing is not surprising: nucleoplasm is filled with spliceosomal components that should be able to associate with nascent RNA, much as ribosomes are capable of translating RNA co-transcriptionally in bacteria \n Nevertheless, some dramatic examples of post-transcriptional splicing \u2013 for example, in anucleate platelets upon activation and in developing fern gametes \u2013 remind us of the potential importance of not splicing co-transcriptionally in certain biological contexts [17,18].\nThe regulatory potential of co-transcriptional splicing is what the field has found so exciting.  \n We asked ourselves: how frequent is co-transcriptional splicing among genes and introns?  \n he first global study on co-transcriptional splicing was undertaken in budding yeast, where it became clear that most introns are spliced co-transcriptionally; 50% of introns are >74% spliced before transcription termination  \n That said, not all intron removal is co-transcriptional. In particular, terminal introns are least well removed co-transcriptionally, and 20% of activated spliceosomes in the cell are not chromatin-associated \n Windhager et al. 2012 [25] calculated the co-transcriptional splicing frequency as the ratio of observed reads in the set of analyzed genes to the number of reads calculated when expecting a uniform read distribution without splicing and weighted for the transcript expression \n Determination of co-transcriptional splicing frequency around a given exon, by subtracting the read coverage over 2kb of the upstream intron  \n from read coverage over 2kb of the 5\u2019 end of the downstream intron  \n Determination of co-transcriptional splicing frequency for each intron, by calculating the ratio of reads around the 3\u2019 splice site: read coverage over the last 25 bp of a given intron, a, is divided by read coverage over the first 25 bp of the downstream exon, b. (d) Determination of co-transcriptional splicing frequency for each gene, by dividing the read coverage over exons by the read coverage over the whole locus. (e) Determination of co-transcriptional splicing frequency (completed splicing index, coSI) around a given exon, using exon-intron and exon-exon junction reads; c, d, and e represent exon-exon junctions; f and g represent exon-intron junctions \n Though Ameur et al. could not calculate co-transcriptional splicing frequencies for short introns genome-wide, their RT-PCR results suggest that high co-transcriptional splicing observed for long introns can also be inferred for shorter ones \n The average co-transcriptional splicing frequencies obtained for each gene will likely be influenced by gene length and the total number of introns within the gene; terminal exons are long and generally full of reads, and terminal introns tend to be least well spliced co-transcriptionally \n The relatively low co-transcriptional splicing frequencies from both mouse studies contrast sharply with the high co-transcriptional splicing frequencies from yeast, fly, and human \n For example, chromatin preparations can be contaminated with mRNA, which is highly abundant and could lead to an over-estimate in the degree of co-transcriptional splicing \n Taken together, this array of high quality global studies enables us to reach a consensus on co-transcriptional splicing: it is widespread, albeit not 100%. \n Nevertheless, an independent, small-scale study focusing on 22 human genes was able to validate the high frequencies of co-transcriptional splicing seen in the global data, even among terminal and alternative introns \n For example, histone modifications, which would have a bearing on co-transcriptional but not post-transcriptional splicing, can directly or indirectly recruit splicing factors and modify alternative splicing \n Co-transcriptional splicing may also have long-lasting effects on the RNA's lifetime, by ensuring proper assembly of export-competent mRNPs [19]. These examples show that co-transcriptional splicing is important for mRNA biogenesis. Co-transcriptional splicing has also emerged as an important regulator of transcriptional activity. \n In this sense, it is important to recognize that no study claims 100% of introns are 100% co-transcriptionally removed. Advances in high-throughput sequencing that enable sequencing of longer DNA molecules (in the kilobase range) will provide clarity and facilitate analysis, as well as providing insight into the order of intron removal and co-transcriptional dynamics of alternative splicing. \n A large body of work in vivo indicates that splicing occurs co-transcriptionally, prior to release of the nascent transcript from RNAP II \n ndeed, recent qPCR data showed that most constitutive exons are removed co-transcriptionally and that alternative exon choice also occurs during transcription  \n In previous work in vivo, Dye and co-workers (13) obtained support for the RNAP II exon-tethering model by showing that a nascent RNAP II transcript that is co-transcriptionally cleaved within the intron is spliced as efficiently as the nascent transcript containing an intact intron \n Together, our data indicate that the spliceosome and the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 exons associate (indirectly or directly) with RNAP II for co-transcriptional splicing. \n Co-transcriptional splicing implies that splicing, at least in part, should occur at the site of transcription. This is supported by kinetic studies showing that splicing is completed within a short \u223c5\u201310 min time-frame from the time of transcription, and these times are not influenced by intron length \n We conclude that co-transcriptional splicing is occurring on the pre-mRNAs associated with the active transcription sites, and that the mRNA processing factors are recruited either via association with the transcribing polymerase or directly with the nascent mRNAs. \n Co-transcriptional splicing occurs at the site of transcription \n We compared a polymerase passing through the MS2 region of an intronless E1 gene to a polymerase moving through the MS2 region of the intron-containing E3/E4 genes that undergo co-transcriptional splicing  \n The plausibility of a co-transcriptional splicing mechanism can be imagined just by the fact that human gene exons tend to be short compared to extremely larger intronic sequences [67], and genes contain an average of 5\u201312 exons [68]. This means that if co-transcriptional splicing did not take place, then the splicing machinery would have to hold back until transcription has completed. \n Splicing can occur during transcript elongation on the co-transcriptional splicing pathway. \n The characteristics of post-transcriptional splicing steps one and two ( and ), and co-transcriptional splicing step two () are determined by model comparison \n In these sections, the occurrence of the first step of splicing of an RNA is represented in the model by a change of state of the associated Pol II, which can make a transition to the co-transcriptional splicing path \n Values for  in pathways III, V and VII imply the same proportion of co-transcriptional splicing, as do the values of  and  in the four remaining pathways where the proportion of co-transcriptional splicing is approximately 85%. \n Pathways I-IV incorporate the feedback mechanism for co-transcriptional splicing step two and this feature correlates with a good fit (low AIC) for all lariat-exon2 species. \n The proportion of co-transcriptional splicing can be calculated from these reaction rates and this proportion can be compared with that predicted for the 40 step model \n However, the rapid accumulation of uncleaved mRNA between 540 and 600 s prior to detection of polyadenylated spliced mRNA at 600 s, clearly shows that co-transcriptional splicing occurs before post-transcriptional splicing. By formally modelling the splicing pathway, we aim to quantify the extent to which mature mRNA is derived from co-transcriptional splicing, and from post-transcriptional splicing respectively. \n The probability of co-transcriptional splicing is not known, and this, along with precise values for all other parameters, will be inferred from fitting the pathway to the data \n  Co-transcriptional splicing is evident in the data, and modelling shows that this pathway may be activated after a delay \n Therefore co-transcriptional splicing is the more efficient pathway under the high induction conditions studied here. \n Cooperativity in the interaction of splicing factors with the spliceosome or with the nascent pre-mRNA may also contribute to the kinetics of co-transcriptional splicing \n The in vitro co-transcriptional splicing system described here provides a new model for elucidating the mechanisms involved in co-transcriptional splicing. \n Does splicing occur co-transcriptionally?",

Herein, we investigated the regulation of STAT3 activation and the therapeutic effects of Icaritin, a prenyl flavonoid derivative from Epimedium Genus, in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).  \n  Overall, these results suggest that Icaritin strongly inhibits STAT3 activation and is a potentially effective therapeutic option for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma \n we have reviewed important signaling pathways that are closely related to radiosensitization, such as cell cycle arrest, tumor angiogenesis, JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway and Mismatch repair \n Interleukin-27 signaling is mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway via activation of STAT1 and STAT3, which have tumor suppressive and oncogenic activities, respectively. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis are key processes in carcinogenesis. \n The inhibition of STAT3 activation had no effect on the development of the epithelial phenotype. \n STAT3 plays a vital role in inducing and maintaining a pro-carcinogenic inflammatory microenvironment and is reported to be a critical mediator of the oncogenic effects of EGFR mutations. STAT3 activation is mediated through JAK family kinases \n  EESB treatment could significantly suppress the activation of several CRC-related pathways, including STAT3, Erk, and p38 signalings in tumor tissues, and alter the expression of multiple critical target genes such as Bcl-2, Bax, Cyclin D1, CDK4, and p21. These molecular effects lead to the induction of cancer cell apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. Our findings demonstrate that SB possesses a broad range of antitumor activities because of its ability to affect multiple intracellular targets \n Western immunoblotting analyses of mouse lung tissues indicated significantly lower level of pSTAT3 and Mcl-1 in the carcinogen plus DMAPT group relative to the group treated with the carcinogen only. Given the evidence that STAT3 is activated in more than half of lung cancers and it regulates genes involved in cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis, DMAPT is a promising agent for lung cancer chemoprevention in subjects who are at high risk of developing this devastating disease. \n (STAT3) is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, originally discovered as a transducer of signal from cell surface receptors to the nucleus. It is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation at position 705 leading to its dimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and activation of gene transcription. Under normal physiological conditions, STAT3 activation is tightly regulated. However, compelling evidence suggests that STAT3 is constitutively activated in many cancers and plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis. It regulates cellular proliferation, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis that are critical for cancer metastasis \n STAT3) signaling pathway plays important roles in oncogenesis, angiogenesis, immunity, and tumor cell invasion. In the present study, we investigated the association of interleukin  \n  Phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) regulates many genes that are necessarily expressed in cancer initiation, development, and progression, being involved in proliferation, anti-apoptosis, invasion, angiogenesis, and immune surveillance evasion \n Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a transcription factor, which can be activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to growth factors and cytokines  \n Upon activation, STAT3 rapidly translocates into nucleus, and binds to recognition sequence in the promoter of target genes (e.g., cyclin D1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, matrix metalloproteinases and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), thereby increasing their transcription [8-10]. All these target genes are implicated in regulation of cell survival, angiogenesis, immune evasion, and inflammation in tumor microenvionment.\nSTAT3 activation contributes to growth stimulation, anti-apoptosis, and angiogenesis, which is signi\ufb01cantly associated with inflammation, immunity, and oncogenesis  \n Consequently, constitutive activation of STAT3 is responsible for a variety of human cancers, including ovarian cancer, breast cancer, leukemia, prostate cancer, head and neck cancer, and pancreatic cancer [13-17]. Blockade of the JAK/STAT3 signal may inhibit the growth of human cancers [17]. Recently, STAT3 has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the maintenance of gastric cancer cells survival [18-22]. Constitutive activation of STAT3 is predictive of poor prognosis in human gastric cancer [23-25]. However, it still remains unknown how activated STAT3 via interleukin (IL)-6-type cytokine signaling associates with T lymphocyte alteration during the progression of human gastric cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine whether IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway associates with T lymphocyte changes, and correlates with the progression of human gastric cancer \n IL-6 and its downstream signals, such as STAT3, play essential roles in the process of in\ufb02ammation and aberrant immunity as well as carcinogenesis [28-30]. STAT3 is activated for a few seconds or hours and then is deactivated to maintain homeostasis under normal circumstance. However, STAT3 activation continues, which triggers oncogene transcription under abnormal conditions [25,31]. Accumulating evidence indicates increased expression and activation of STAT3 in human gastric carcinoma [18-25,32]. It remains unclear whether increased IL-6/STAT3 activation correlates with aberrant immunity in the progression and invasion of gastric cancer. In the present study, we observed the levels of IL-6, IL-10 and VEGF in serum were significant decreased after removal of gastric cancer. \n It has been shown that STAT3 activation in tumor cells can mediate an immune response by inhibiting the activity of immune cells through inflammatory cytokines probably release from invading tumor tissue  \n It is observed that aberrant STAT3 activation in tumor cells is associated with cell proliferation, cell survival, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis [11] (Figure 1). Conversely, targeting STAT3 activation inhibits tumor growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo without affecting normal cells, thus suggesting that STAT3 could be a valid molecular target for cancer therapy  \n Role of STAT3 in Cancer Metastasis\nCancer metastasis is a complex, multistep process in which tumor cells primarily invades surrounding tissue and basement membrane, thus entering into blood circulation; while surviving during circulation, the tumor cells extravasate and adhere into distant organ and induce angiogenesis to form secondary tumor. \n Compelling evidence supports the fact that STAT3 activation plays a critical role in every step of metastasis including cell proliferation and survival, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis  \n Translational Advances\nSTAT3 is excessively active in many cancers and plays a central role in tumorigenesis. Several lines of evidence have implicated that inhibition of STAT3 with a dominant negative form of STAT3 or other inhibitors attenuates the proliferation and survival of a wide variety of cancers with little or no effects on normal cells  \n IL-27 elicits its effects through activation of both STAT1 and STAT3, which have opposing roles in carcinogenesis [1,2,8,11-15]. Activated STAT1 signaling has tumor suppressive roles by inhibiting angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis as well as promoting apoptosis [12,16]. Alternatively, the STAT3 pathway has been shown to be constitutively activated in many human cancers and has been implicated in oncogenic transformation and progression  \n In cancer, STAT3 has been implicated in EGF-mediated EMT in ovarian cancer cell lines and STAT1 has been reported to inhibit angiogenesis in murine fibrosarcoma tumor cells  \n We report that IL-27-mediated induction of MET and inhibition of angiogenic factors is STAT1-dependent, and inhibition of STAT1 activity results in induction of a mesenchymal phenotype and angiogenic factors above basal levels implicating an overwhelming STAT3 effect. These findings suggest that STAT1 activation may play an important role in repressing STAT3 in lung carcinogenesis, and suggest that better understanding of STAT signaling by cytokines such as IL-27 may shed light to potential new targets in cancer prevention and therapy \n STAT3 is also reported to have a leading role in cancer inflammation and immunity [19], [20], [21], [22]. Many tumor-derived factors, such as IL-10, IL-6 and VEGF that are crucial for both tumor growth and immunosuppression, activate STAT3 to create an efficient \u201cfeed-forward\u201d loop to induce persistent STAT3 activity in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment [19], [23], [24], [25] \n Additionally, Icaritin inhibited tumor angiogenesis, potently suppressed STAT3 activation, and significantly reduced RCC tumor growth in vivo. These data suggest that Icaritin is a specific inhibitor of JAK2/STAT3 activation and may represent a viable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of advanced RCC \n Activated STAT3 promotes tumorigenesis by preventing apoptosis and enhancing proliferation, angiogenesis, invasiveness, and immune evasion [21], [45], [46], [47], [48]. In various cancer types, including leukemias and solid cancers of the breast, head and neck, melanoma, prostate, pancreas, and colon, aberrant activation of STAT3 crucially contributes to cancer progression [13]. \n Is signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) critical for tumor angiogenesis progression?",

        "question": "Junctin, a 26 kDa intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein, forms a quaternary complex with triadin, calsequestrin and the ryanodine receptor (RyR) at the junctional SR membrane.  \n Junctin ablation appears to affect how RyRs 'sense' SR Ca(2+) load, resulting in decreased diastolic SR Ca(2+) leak despite an elevated [Ca(2+)](SR).  \n Single channel recordings of RyRs from WT and JCN-KO cardiac SR indicate that the absence of junctin produces a dual effect on the normally linear response of RyRs to luminal [Ca(2+)]: at low luminal [Ca(2+)] (<1 mmol l(-1)), junctin-devoid RyR channels are less responsive to luminal [Ca(2+)]; conversely, high luminal [Ca(2+)] turns them hypersensitive to this form of channel modulation. Thus, junctin produces complex effects on Ca(2+) sparks, transients, and leak, but the luminal [Ca(2+)]-dependent dual response of junctin-devoid RyRs demonstrates that junctin normally acts as an activator of RyR channels at low luminal [Ca(2+)], and as an inhibitor at high luminal [Ca(2+)]. \n Normal Ca(2+) signalling in skeletal muscle depends on the membrane associated proteins triadin and junctin and their ability to mediate functional interactions between the Ca(2+) binding protein calsequestrin and the type 1 ryanodine receptor in the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. \n We show here that purified skeletal ryanodine receptors are similarly activated by purified triadin or purified junctin added to their luminal side, although a lack of competition indicated that the proteins act at independent sites. Surprisingly, triadin and junctin differed markedly in their ability to transmit information between skeletal calsequestrin and ryanodine receptors. Purified calsequestrin inhibited junctin/triadin-associated, or junctin-associated, ryanodine receptors and the calsequestrin re-associated channel complexes were further inhibited when luminal Ca(2+) fell from 1mM to \n By fusing GCaMP6f to the N-terminus of triadin 1 or junctin, GCaMP6f-T/J was targeted to dyadic junctions, where it colocalized with t-tubules and RyRs after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer.  \n The junctional face of the jSR, facing the transverse tubules, is occupied by a molecular complex composed of the transmembrane Ca2+ release channels (ryanodine receptors); the luminal protein calsequestrin (CSQ); the 2 membrane proteins, junctin (Jct), and triadin (Tr), which mediate CSQ-ryanodine receptor interactions; and several other components. \n Calsequestrin, the main calcium buffer in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, provides a pool of calcium for release through the ryanodine receptor and acts as a luminal calcium sensor for the channel via its interactions with triadin and junctin. We examined the influence of phosphorylation of calsequestrin on its ability to store calcium, to polymerise and to regulate ryanodine receptors by binding to triadin and junctin.  \n Junctin is a 26 kDa membrane protein that binds to calsequestrin, triadin, and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) within the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of calcium release units.  \n Is there a relationship between junctin and ryanodine receptors?",

Akathisia was more common with molindone and elevated prolactin concentrations more common with risperidone. Although weight gain and metabolic adverse events had occurred more often with olanzapine and risperidone during the acute trial, no significant between-drug differences emerged in most of these parameters during maintenance treatment.  \n Olanzapine and risperidone were associated with significantly greater weight gain. Olanzapine showed the greatest risk of weight gain and significant increases in fasting cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, insulin, and liver transaminase levels. Molindone led to more self-reports of akathisia.  \n Molindone is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but it does cause significantly more weight loss (2RCTs n=60 RR 2.78, CI 1.10 to 6.99, NNH 5 CI 2 to 77).  \n Molindone may be an effective antipsychotic but its adverse effect profile does not differ significantly from that of typical antipsychotics (apart from the event of weight loss).  \n Convergent evidence suggests a hierarchy in the magnitude of BWG that may be induced by diverse agents, being very high for clozapine and olanzapine; high for quetiapine, zotepin, chlorpromazine, and thioridazine; moderate for risperidone and sertindole; and low for ziprazidone, amisulpiride, haloperidol, fluphenazine, pimozide, and molindone.  \n Loxapine and molindone induce weight decreases, and these exceptions are difficult to explain. \n It is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but causes significantly more weight loss (RR 2.78, CI 1.10 to 6.99). \n Molindone may be an effective antipsychotic; however, its adverse effect profile does not differ significantly from that of typical antipsychotics, apart from the event of weight loss.  \n Among conventional agents, mean weight change ranged from a reduction of 0.39 kg with molindone to an increase of 3.19 kg with thioridazine. \n Weight gain has been reported with nearly every antipsychotic drug on the market (molindone is an exception).  \n Although almost all antipsychotics induce bodyweight gain, molindone and loxapine appear to induce bodyweight loss.  \n Clozapine and low-potency phenothiazines are associated with the largest gains and molindone with weight loss, but the mechanism is not known.  \n On average, molindone patients lost 5 pounds over the 6 weeks of treatment, whereas thioridazine patients gained 6 pounds.  \n Clinically, molindone has a tendency to cause weight loss and may have less effect on seizure threshold than conventional antipsychotic agents \n  Monthly weights and neuroleptic dosages during the first three months of psychiatric hospitalization were compared between matched groups of patients receiving molindone, a combination of molindone and other neuroleptics, or other neuroleptic drugs. We found no significant differences in weight gain among the three groups.  \n The weight-reducing property of molindone, a recently introduced antipsychotic drug, was tested in 9 hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients.

Stress or anxiety-induced release of endogenous catecholamines causes a dysfunction in the myocytic calcium-ion channel, leading to ventricular arrhythmias that can cause dizziness, syncope, or sudden cardiac death.  \n During a follow-up of 48\u00b194 months, arrhythmia events (sudden cardiac death and aborted cardiac arrest) associated with noncompliance occurred in 2 patients.  \n We report a family with repeat events of sudden cardiac death and recurrent ventricular fibrillation in a teenage girl, where autopsy data and clinical investigations were inconclusive. The diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) was established only following finding a gene mutation in the cardiac ryanodine receptor.  \n Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a devastating inherited disorder characterized by episodic syncope and/or sudden cardiac arrest during exercise or acute emotion in individuals without structural cardiac abnormalities. Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals.  \n catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS), leave no evidence to be found at autopsy \n a spectrum of sudden cardiac death (SCD)-predisposing heritable cardiac arrhythmia syndromes, including long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).  \n CPVT is a familial arrhythmogenic syndrome characterized by abnormal calcium (Ca(2+)) handling, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death \n Mutations in RyR2 are linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and sudden cardiac death. \n Patients with CPVT often present with exercise- or emotion induced syncope, the first presentation can also be sudden cardiac death. \n Among the five major arrhythmogenic disorders occurring in the absence of a structural heart disease is catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), which is a highly lethal form of inherited arrhythmias.  \n Patients with CPVT are at high risk of developing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias when untreated.  \n Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome characterized by VT induced by adrenergic stress in the absence of structural heart disease and high incidence of sudden cardiac death.  \n CPVT is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome caused by gene mutations that destabilize cardiac ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release channels. Sudden cardiac death is incompletely prevented by conventional drug therapy with \u03b2-blockers with or without Ca(2+) channel blockers.  \n Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease that can cause sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). \n Important potential causes of sudden cardiac deaths in the absence of heart disease are primary electrical diseases such as Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias.  \n catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS) are primary inherited arrhythmia syndromes that may cause syncope and sudden cardiac death in young individuals.  \n Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a cardiac channelopathy characterized by altered intracellular calcium handling resulting in ventricular arrhythmias and high risk of cardiac sudden death in young cases with normal structural hearts.  \n Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disorder that causes syncopal episodes related with stress or emotion and even sudden cardiac deaths. \n Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia caused by mutations in the RyR2 gene manifests as severe arrhythmias, and may provide a candidate for sudden cardiac deaths. \n Patients diagnosed with an electrical cardiomyopathy have an increased risk of syncope and sudden cardiac death (SCD).  \n Patients with CPVT present with exercise-induced syncope and sudden cardiac death but normal resting electrocardiograms.  \n Over 80% of SCD occurs in patients with organic heart disease. However, approximately 10-15% of SCD occurs in the presence of structurally normal heart and the majority of those patients are young. In this group of patients, changes in genes encoding cardiac ion channels produce modification of the function of the channel resulting in an electrophysiological substrate of VA and SCD.

Both patients responded rapidly to treatment and subsequently developed CD4 lymphopenia. \n T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a chemotherapy-resistant malignancy with a median survival of 7.5 months. Preliminary results indicated a high remission induction rate with the human CD52 antibody, CAMPATH-1H.  \n CAMPATH-1H (30 mg) was administered intravenously 3 times weekly until maximal response. The overall response rate was 76% with 60% CR and 16% partial remission (PR). These responses were durable with a median disease-free interval of 7 months (range, 4-45 months).  \n The conclusion is that CAMPATH-1H is an effective therapy in T-PLL, producing remissions in more than two thirds of patients.  \n For example, most patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, including those with large tumor burdens and high peripheral white blood cell counts, will enter complete remission using the antibody CAMPATH-1H without any evidence of tumor lysis. \n Overall response rate to FMC was 68%, comprising 6 complete remissions (all bone-marrow confirmed) and 11 partial remissions.

        "question": "Sleep bruxism is prevalent in GERD patients, and GERD is highly associated with SB. \n There was a statistical trend towards tooth wear progression being associated with gastric risk factors (p < 0.05).  \n This article presents a case report of a 27-year-old male smoker with tooth wear and dentin sensitivity caused by GERD associated with bruxism.  \n The aim of this cross-over, randomized, single-blinded trial was to examine whether intra-esophageal acidification induces sleep bruxism (SB).  \n RMMA episodes including SB were induced by esophageal acidification.  \n Chronic regurgitation of gastric acids in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease may cause dental erosion, which can lead in combination with attrition or bruxism to extensive loss of coronal tooth tissue. \n This clinical report describes treatment of severe tooth wear of a gastroesophageal reflux disease patient who is 54-year-old Turkish male patient. After his medical treatment, severe tooth wear, bruxism and decreased vertical dimensions were determined.  \n Gastroesophageal reflux disease by itself or in combination with attrition, abrasion or bruxism may be responsible for the loss. \n The association between bruxism, feeding and smoking habits and digestive disorders may lead to serious consequences to dental and related structures, involving dental alterations (wear, fractures and cracks), periodontal signs (gingival recession and tooth mobility) and muscle-joint sensitivity, demanding a multidisciplinary treatment plan. This paper presents a case report in which bruxism associated with acid feeding, smoking habit and episodes of gastric reflow caused severe tooth wear and great muscular discomfort with daily headache episodes.  \n The frequencies of RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes were significantly higher during decreased esophageal pH episodes than those during other times.  \n These results suggest that most jaw muscle activities, ie, RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes, occur in relation to gastroesophageal reflux mainly in the supine position. \n Nocturnal bruxism may be secondary to nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, occurring via sleep arousal and often together with swallowing. \n Is there an association between bruxism and reflux?",

        "question": "As the syndrome occurred after the acute cholinergic syndrome but before organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy, the syndrome was called 'intermediate syndrome'. \n The characteristic features of the IMS are weakness of the muscles of respiration (diaphragm, intercostal muscles and accessory muscles including neck muscles) and of proximal limb muscles. Accompanying features often include weakness of muscles innervated by some cranial nerves. It is now emerging that the degree and extent of muscle weakness may vary following the onset of the IMS.  \n Electrophysiological studies following OP poisoning have revealed three characteristic phenomena: (i) repetitive firing following a single stimulus; (ii) gradual reduction in twitch height or compound muscle action potential followed by an increase with repetitive stimulation (the 'decrement-increment response'); and (iii) continued reduction in twitch height or compound muscle action potential with repetitive simulation ('decrementing response').  \n Organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy is a sensory-motor distal axonopathy which usually occurs after exposure of certain OP insecticides. Neuropathies due to ingestion of OPs have rarely been reported in the literature. \n We report a patient with serious organophosphorus-induced delayed neuropathy due to malathion injection. The patient was a 32-year-old female who self-injected undetermined amounts of malathion over the median nerve trace on the forearm crease in a suicide attempt which resulted in peripheral neuropathy. \n  Acutely, these patients present with cholinergic crisis; intermediate syndrome and delayed polyneuropathy are other sequel of this form of poisoning. \n There was no strong evidence of irreversible peripheral nerve damage following acute OP poisoning, however further studies are required. \n Particular interactions are also addressed, such as those of pesticides acting as endocrine disruptors, the cumulative toxicity of organophosphates and organochlorines resulting in estrogenic effects and the promotion of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy. \n The multivariate analyses showed that the population living in areas with high pesticide use had an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease and suicide attempts and that males living in these areas had increased risks for polyneuropathies, affective disorders and suicide attempts.  \n These compounds cause four important neurotoxic effects in humans: the cholinergic syndrome, the intermediate syndrome, organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) and chronic organophosphate-induced neuropsychiatric disorder (COPIND).  \n An 18-year-old woman and a 22-year-old man were admitted to the hospital with weakness, paresthesia, and gait disturbances at 35 and 22 days, respectively, after ingesting dimethyl-2,2-dichloro vinyl phosphate (DDVP). Neurological examination revealed weakness, vibration sense loss, bilateral dropped foot, brisk deep tendon reflexes, and bilaterally positive Babinski sign. Electroneurography demonstrated distal motor polyneuropathy with segmental demyelination associated with axonal degeneration prominent in the distal parts of both lower extremities. \n Sensory complaints and electrodiagnostic findings consistent with polyneuropathy were found in a minority (3/7) of subjects 28 years after an acute toxic arsenic exposure. \n Organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) is a rare toxicity resulting from exposure to certain organophosphorus (OP) esters.  \n Therefore, OPIDP may develop only after very large exposures to insecticides, causing severe cholinergic toxicity. \n Several studies have reported the occurrence of sensory neuropathy with exposure to chlorpyrifos and other organophosphorus insecticides, at levels not associated with overt toxicity.  \n We found no evidence of sensory neuropathy or isolated peripheral abnormalities among subjects with long-term chlorpyrifos exposure at levels known to be associated with the manufacturing process. \n Persistent, mainly motor, impairment of the peripheral nervous system was found in men two years after OP poisoning, in particular in severe occupational and intentional poisonings with neuropathic OPs. This finding is possibly due to remaining organophosphate induced delayed polyneuropathy. \n Besides the well known acute cholinergic toxicity, these compounds may cause late-onset distal polyneuropathy occurring two to three weeks after the acute exposure.  \n Electromyography demonstrated motor weighed sensory-motor polyneuropathy with axonal degeneration significant in the distal parts of bilateral lower extremities.  \n The two cases are presented here since organophosphate poisonings are common in our country, and since late-onset polyneuropathy is not a well known clinical presentation as acute toxicity. \n The course of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDP) in humans has not been quantitatively measured in epidemiologic studies. \n The persistence of deficits in motor strength in all severely poisoned patients regardless of pesticide type was unexpected, and may reflect persistent cholinergic blockade or intermediate syndrome, neuropathy, or a combination of these. \n The findings showed a strong association between exposure to OP concentrate and neurological symptoms, but a less consistent association with sensory thresholds.  \n Following accidental or suicidal exposure, these anticholinesterases lead to three well defined neurological syndromes i.e. initial life threatening acute cholinergic crisis which often requires management in intensive care unit, intermediate syndrome in which cranial nerve palsies, proximal muscle weakness and respiratory muscle weakness are common and patients often require respiratory support and delayed organophosphate induced polyneuropathy. \n [Late onset polyneuropathy due to exposure to organophosphates]. \n  Less often a polyneuropathic syndrome of late onset may occur. \n On electromyography there was sensomotor peripheral polyneuropathy, which was primarily axonal and predominantly motor and distal. Peripheral nerve biopsy confirmed the presence of 'dying back' type axonopathy.  \n Agricultural workers chronically exposed to organophosphate insecticides, without adequate protection, have an increased risk of developing late onset neuropathy due to organophosphates.  \n Epidemiologic studies on pesticides have found associations with long-term effects on health mainly in three fields: cancer (especially hematological cancer), neurotoxic effects (polyneuropathy, neuro-behavioral hazards, Parkinson's disease), and reproductive disorders (infertility, birth defects, adverse pregnancy outcomes, perinatal mortality).  \n EMG studies showed evidence of partial denervation of the anterior tibial group of muscles and flexor digiti minimi in 2 of the 30 workers (6.7%) who underwent EMG examination. \n Neurological symptoms consist in cerebro-organic disfunctions, locomotory disorders reminiscent of multiple sclerosis or M. Parkinson, and sensory, motoric and vegetative polyneuropathy, leading, for instance, to cardiovascular regulatory disorder like sympathicotonia or, orthostatic hypotonia.  \n Thirty percent of patients had definite or possible exposure to organophosphate pesticides, and the peak use coincides with the peak incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. \n These results suggest that previously reported cases of organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy may represent only the worst disease in a spectrum of impairment, a sequela of exposure that may be much more common than previously thought. \n It is suggested that the main cause of nervous lesions in these cases was the complex effect of pesticides. \n Delayed polyneuropathy develops within 1 to 3 weeks and abates after 6 to 12 months.  \n Isolated case reports have circumstantially linked the use of the herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) to polyneuropathy. \n Thus, the weight of evidence indicates that 2,4-D is an unlikely cause of polyneuropathy. \n A patient is reported presenting a cerebellar disorder developing about 5 weeks after acute exposure to an organophosphate insecticide.  \n Less well known, but more complex and idiosyncratic, is the potential for some agents to produce a delayed and progressive polyneuropathy--Organophosphorus Induced Delayed Neurotox-icity (OPIDN). \n  It is also quite probable that human neurotoxicity may be a potential hazard from exposure to more than the handful of organophosphorus pesticides that have been described in the literature. \n In the present study the electroencephalograms of 3 of a group 10 workmen, who had been continually exposed to hexachlorcyclohexane, show pathological findings. The electromyograms of 8 of these 10 workman demonstrate a disturbance of the peripherical motoneuron. All probands, who exhibit o pathological EEG, also show a polyneuropathy. \n Many organophosphorus compounds, including the organophosphate insecticides, may cause polyneuropathy of delayed onset. \n Nevertheless, we describe a patient with delayed polyneuropathy after suicidal ingestion of parathion. \n OP poisoning leads to four well defined neurological syndromes, namely acute cholinergic crisis, intermediate syndrome, organophosphate induced delayed polyneuropathy (OPIDN) and chronic organophosphate induced neuropsychiatric disorders (COPIND) [5]. \n Occupation matched controls were recruited since there is evidence that occupational exposure to pesticides can cause neuropathies. \n Following acute organophosphorus (OP) poisoning patients complain of numbness without objective sensory abnormalities or other features of OP induced delayed polyneuropathy.  \n Human studies of nerve function in farm workers who had chronic, probably low level exposure to pesticides show sensory and motor neuropathy [8], [9], [10], [11], [12].  \n Is pesticide exposure associated with polyneuropathy?",

        "question": "The use of high-flow nasal cannulae is an increasingly popular alternative to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for noninvasive respiratory support of very preterm infants (gestational age, <32 weeks) after extubation. \n The use of high-flow nasal cannulae was noninferior to the use of nasal CPAP, with treatment failure occurring in 52 of 152 infants (34.2%) in the nasal-cannulae group and in 39 of 151 infants (25.8%) in the CPAP group (risk difference, 8.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -1.9 to 18.7).  \n Although the result for the primary outcome was close to the margin of noninferiority, the efficacy of high-flow nasal cannulae was similar to that of CPAP as respiratory support for very preterm infants after extubation.  \n Recently high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is emerging as an efficient, better tolerated form of NIV, allowing better access to the baby's face, which may improve nursing, feeding and bonding. \n In conclusion, there is a growing evidence of the feasibility of HFNC as an alternative mode of NIV.  \n HHHFNC and NCPAP produced similar rates of extubation failure. \n The use of HFNC as a respiratory support modality is increasing in the infant, pediatric, and adult populations as an alternative to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. \n Current evidence suggests that HFNC is well tolerated and may be feasible in a subset of patients who require ventilatory support with non-invasive ventilation. \n Heated, humidified, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HHHFNC) has been used to improve ventilation in preterm infants.  \n Increasing flow rates of HHHFNC therapy are associated with linear increases in NP pressures in bronchiolitis patients.  \n An alternative to the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) as a non-invasive modality to support respiratory distress in premature infants has been the recent introduction of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) devices in many neonatal units. There has been increased use of HFNC presumably because of anecdotal reports and experience that it is easy to use, and well tolerated by the infants, while experiencing decreased nasal septumerosion. \n High-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) are gaining in popularity as a form of non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units around the world. \n HFNC may be as effective as NCPAP at improving respiratory parameters such as tidal volume and work of breathing in preterm infants, but probably only at flow rates >2 litres/min.  \n There is growing evidence of the feasibility of HFNC as an alternative to other forms of non-invasive ventilation in preterm infants.  \n When used as primary respiratory support after birth, one trial found similar rates of treatment failure in infants treated with HFNC and nasal CPAP. Following extubation, one trial found that infants treated with HFNC had a significantly higher rate of reintubation than those treated with nasal CPAP. Another trial found similar rates of reintubation for humidified and non-humidified HFNC, and the fourth trial found no difference between two different models of equipment used to deliver humidified HFNC.  \n When used following extubation, HFNC may be associated with a higher rate of reintubation than nasal CPAP.  \n Early weaning from CPAP to high flow nasal cannula in preterm infants is associated with prolonged oxygen requirement: a randomized controlled trial. \n After randomization, the no-NC group had fewer days on oxygen [median (interquartile range): 5 (1-8) vs 14 (7.5-19.25) days, p<0.001] and shorter duration of respiratory support [10.5 (4-21) vs 18 (11.5-29) days, p=0.03]. There were no differences between groups regarding success of weaning from NCPAP.  \n Weaning preterm infants from NCPAP to NC is associated with increased exposure to oxygen and longer duration of respiratory support. \n A number of centers use high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in the management of AOP without measuring the positive distending pressure (PDP) generated. \n HFNC is as effective as NCPAP in the management of AOP. \n Are high-flow nasal cannulae effective for treatment of preterm infants?",

        "question": "Statins have been shown in two recent small phase I/II trials to be associated with a marked reduction in clinical and transcranial Doppler (TCD) evidence of vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH).  \n Statins did not result in reduced TCD velocities, clinical or angiographic vasospasm, or improvements in global outcome at the time of hospital discharge.  \n There remains significant uncertainty as to the role of statins in preventing vasospasm after SAH. \n Although the results of 2 randomized clinical trials demonstrated that statin decreases the incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm after aSAH, retrospective studies have failed to confirm this. \n There were no differences in the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm (25.3 vs 30.5%; p = 0.277), in-hospital mortality rate (18 vs 15%; p = 0.468), length of hospitalization (21 +/- 15 vs 19 +/- 12 days; p = 0.281), or poor outcome at discharge (Glasgow Outcome Scale Scores 1-2: 21.7 vs 18.2%; p = 0.416) between the simvastatin and nonstatin cohorts.  \n The uniform introduction of simvastatin did not reduce the incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm, death, or poor outcome in patients with aSAH. Simvastatin was well tolerated, but its benefit may be less than has been previously reported. \n Cholesterol-reducing agents might improve unfavourable outcomes. \n We cannot draw any conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of lowering cholesterol in aneurysmal SAH because of insufficient reliable evidence from only one small trial. \n Experimental evidence has indicated the benefit of simvastatin in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage. \n There was an improvement in the functional outcome in the simvastatin group at 1, 3 or 6 months in the follow-up; however, this difference was not statistically significant. \n  There was benefit of simvastatin in terms of reduction in clinical vasospasm, mortality or improved functional outcome, however, this was not statistically significant. \n Cerebral vasomotor reactivity, however, is significantly improved after long-term statin administration in most patients with severe small vessel disease, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, or impaired baseline CA. \n Atorvastatin decreases computed tomography and S100-assessed brain ischemia after subarachnoid aneurysmal hemorrhage: a comparative study. \n In the overall population, cerebral vasospasm was significantly less common in the statin-treated group. Severity of vasospasm, as assessed on the most severe angiogram, was lowered with statin. Statins significantly reduced volume of ischemia in patients with vasospasm and an uncomplicated coiling procedure. S100B levels were significantly lower in statin-treated patients, and the decrease was greatest among high-grade patients (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons 3-5). No differences were found between statin-treated and untreated groups regarding rescue therapy intensity or 1-yr clinical outcomes. \n Atorvastatin reduces the incidence, the severity and the ischemic consequences of vasospasm as assessed on computed tomography. In high-grade World Federation of Neurological Surgeons patients, atorvastatin decreases serum levels of S100B, a biomarker of brain ischemia. Despite these positive effects on biomarkers, no improvement of outcome was seen in the overall population, although there was a tendency for a better clinical outcome in high-grade patients. \n 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been associated with improved clinical outcomes after ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage, but with an increased risk of incidental spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). \n Statins are known to have pleiotropic vascular effects, some of which may interrupt the pathogenesis of DNDs. Based on promising preliminary reports, many clinicians routinely administer statins to prevent DNDs. \n However, observational studies have not revealed an association between statin-use and reduced DNDs or improved neurological outcomes. Results of RCTs have been inconsistent and limited by small sample size, but together suggest that statins may reduce DNDs, with no clear impact on mortality or neurological recovery. \n the role of statins in the management of patients with SAH remains unclear. Although promising, statins should not, at this time, be considered standard care. \n In patients with SAH, they may decrease the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm, although the effects on overall outcome are less clear. \n Statins treatment may have potential clinical impact in vascular disease beyond cholesterol lowering. Its benefits have been documented in cerebral ischaemia and in subarachnoid haemorrhage. \n A recent meta-analysis investigating the efficacy of statin treatment in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage reported a reduced incidence of vasospasm, delayed cerebral ischemia, and mortality in statin-treated patients. \n The results of the present systematic review do not lend statistically significant support to the finding of a beneficial effect of statins in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage as reported in a previous meta-analysis. \n Pre-treatment with cholesterol lowering drugs of the statin family may exert protective effects in patients with ischaemic stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage but their effects are not clear in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH).  \n Recently, two randomized controlled phase II studies showed that acute initiation of statin treatment directly after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) decreases the incidence of radiologic vasospasm and clinical signs of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), and even reduces mortality. \n We conclude that both the primary and secondary outcome results of this study do not support a beneficial effect of simvastatin in patients with SAH. \n Novel uses of their anti-inflammatory properties in sepsis and vasomotor properties in subarachnoid haemorrhage are being further investigated by randomised trials. \n A trend towards a lower mortality within 14 days in patients receiving solely simvastatin and those receiving statin and magnesium as compared with the control group was found.  \n Initiation of statin therapy after aneurysmal SAH significantly reduces the incidence of vasospasm, delayed ischemic deficits, and mortality. \n The addition of statins to standard care was not associated with any reduction in the development of vasospasm or improvement in outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  \n We have previously demonstrated that acute pravastatin therapy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ameliorates vasospasm-related delayed ischemic deficits. \n  This trial demonstrates that acute statin treatment reduces traditional rescue therapy for vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Improvement in early outcome has proved robust at 6 months, particularly in relation to physical and psychosocial (Short Form 36) outcome. \n The authors previously have demonstrated that acute treatment with pravastatin after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can ameliorate vasospasm-related delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DINDs). \n The neuroprotective effects of acute treatment with pravastatin following aneurysmal SAH are associated with enhancement of autoregulation \n Simvastatin reduces vasospasm after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: results of a pilot randomized clinical trial. \n The use of simvastatin as prophylaxis against delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal SAH is a safe and well-tolerated intervention. Its use attenuates serum markers associated with brain injury and decreases the incidence of radiographic vasospasm and delayed ischemic deficit. \n Acute treatment with pravastatin after aSAH is safe and ameliorates cerebral vasospasm, improves cerebral autoregulation, and reduces vasospasm-related DID. \n  SAH statin users demonstrated significant improvement in 14-day functional outcome, a significantly lower incidence of DCI and cerebral infarctions of any type, as well as prevention of TCD highest mean velocity elevation. However, we did not find a significant statin impact on mortality or global outcome (Modified Rankin Scale) in this small sample.  \n Is statin use associated with improved outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?",

        "question": "Borna disease virus (BDV), a nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA virus, infects a wide variety of mammalian species and readily establishes a long-lasting, persistent infection in brain cells.  \n To investigate the biological characteristics of field isolates of Borna disease virus (BDV), as well as to understand BDV infections outside endemic countries, we isolated the virus from brain samples of a heifer with Borna disease in Japan. \n Neonatal Borna disease virus (BDV) infection of the rat brain is associated with microglial activation and damage to the certain neuronal populations. \n In addition, compared to uninfected mixed cultures, activation of microglia in BDV-infected mixed cultures was associated with a significantly greater lipopolysaccharide-induced release of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 10. Taken together, the present data are the first in vitro evidence that persistent BDV infection of neurons and astrocytes rather than direct exposure to the virus or dying neurons is critical for activating microglia. \n Usually, Borna disease virus is not cleared from the brain but rather persists in neural cells. \n Varied persistent life cycles of Borna disease virus in a human oligodendroglioma cell line. \n Borna disease virus (BDV) establishes a persistent infection in the central nervous system of vertebrate animal species as well as in tissue cultures.  \n Thus, our findings show that BDV may have established a persistent infection at low levels of viral expression in OL cells with the possibility of a latent infection. \n These results suggested that BDV infection may cause direct damage in the developing brain by inhibiting the function of amphoterin due to binding by the p24 phosphoprotein. \n We describe a model for investigating disorders of central nervous system development based on neonatal rat infection with Borna disease virus, a neurotropic noncytolytic RNA virus.  \n Borna disease virus (BDV) replicates in brain cells.

Evidence from clinical trials using these commonly prescribed pharmacological agents suggests positive changes in the neurological status in patients, leading sometimes to dramatic improvements. \n Pharmaceuticals that act in the oxygen based amino acid systems of the brain include the GABAergic medications zolpidem and baclofen, while those that act in the monoamine axes include the dopaminergic medications L Dopa, amantadine, bromocriptine, apomorphine and methylphenidate, and the noradrenergic and serotonergic medications desipramine, amitriptyline, protriptyline and fluoxetine.  \n Sporadic cases of recovery from a DOC have been reported after the administration of various pharmacological agents (baclofen, zolpidem, amantadine etc.). \n Amantadine hydrochloride is one of the most commonly prescribed medications for patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness after traumatic brain injury. Preliminary studies have suggested that amantadine may promote functional recovery. \n  During the 4-week treatment period, recovery was significantly faster in the amantadine group than in the placebo group, as measured by the DRS score (difference in slope, 0.24 points per week; P=0.007), indicating a benefit with respect to the primary outcome measure.  \n Amantadine accelerated the pace of functional recovery during active treatment in patients with post-traumatic disorders of consciousness. \n Sporadic cases of dramatic recovery from DOC after the administration of various pharmacological agents, such as baclofen, zolpidem and amantadine, have been recently supported by intriguing scientific observations.  \n According to the 16 eligible studies, medical management by dopaminergic agents (levodopa, amantadine), zolpidem and median nerve stimulation, or surgical management by deep brain stimulation, extradural cortical stimulation, spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal baclofen have shown to improve the level of consciousness in certain cases.  \n Higher exposure of amantadine (average concentration of amantadine during 6 mg/kg/day > 1.5 mg/L) may be associated with better recovery of consciousness.  \n Based on the preliminary data, higher dosing may be considered in the setting of brain injury. \n Patients treated with PK-Merz exhibited the more significant restoration of consciousness and better dynamics (regress) of neurological deficit with the most intensive restoration of neurological deficit in the first day that allows to recommend the use of amantadine sulfate in the first hours of ischemic stroke and for the prevention of reperfusion damage in recanalisation therapy of ischemic stroke. \n There was no significant difference in the slopes of recovery during either arm for the Coma/Near-Coma Scale (P = 0.24) or the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (P = 0.28), although improvements in consciousness were noted by the physician during weeks when amantadine was given (P = 0.02).  \n This study suggests that amantadine facilitates recovery of consciousness in pediatric acquired brain injury and provides important information necessary to design future more definitive studies. \n The study has shown a positive effect of this drug at coma emergence, which manifested itself as clinical improvement and a better outcome of the disease. \n This article will review the evidence for the use of psychostimulants (methylphenidate), antidepressants (amitriptyline, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buproprion), Parkinson's medications (amantadine, bromocriptine, carbidopa/levodopa), anticonvulsants (valproic acid), modafinil (Provigil), lactate, hyperbaric oxygen chamber, electroconvulsive therapy, and transmagnetic stimulation, in patients following a head injury. \n Of the psychoactive medications, amantadine hydrochloride was associated with greater recovery and dantrolene sodium was associated with less recovery, in terms of the DRS score at 16 weeks but not the time until commands were followed. \n Is amantadine effective for treatment of disorders conciousness?",

        "question": "Herceptin is widely used in treating Her2-overexpressing breast cancer. However, the application of Herceptin in prostate cancer is still controversial. \n Our data demonstrate that Re-188-labeled Herceptin effectively inhibited the growth of DU145 cells compared to the Herceptin- and Re-188-treated cohorts. This implies that targeting Her2 by both radio- and immuno- therapy might be a potential strategy for treating patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer. \n epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family members are potential targets for therapy using extra-cellular domain receptor binding agents, such as the antibodies trastuzumab and cetuximab \n  there were tendencies for upregulation of HER2, increased co-expression of EGFR and HER2 and downregulation of HER3 in the prostate cancer lymph node metastases in comparison to the primary tumors.  \n We performed a comparative analysis in vitro and in vivo of the antitumor effects of three different antibodies targeting different epitopes of ErbB2: Herceptin (trastuzumab), 2C4 (pertuzumab) and Erb-hcAb (human anti-ErbB2-compact antibody), a novel fully human compact antibody produced in our laboratory. Herein, we demonstrate that the growth of both androgen-dependent and independent prostate cancer cells was efficiently inhibited by Erb-hcAb. The antitumor effects induced by Erb-hcAb on some cell lines were more potent than those observed for either Herceptin or 2C4. \n These findings suggest that a systemic delivery of 212Pb-trastuzumab could             be an effective modality for management of advanced human prostate cancer. \n Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) overexpression supports proliferation of androgen-independent prostate cancer (PC) \n Radiolabeled ABY-025 Affibody molecule provides higher contrast in imaging of HER2-expressing PC xenografts than radiolabeled trastuzumab.  \n These studies indicate that dual EGFR/HER2 inhibition, administered together with AWT, sensitize prostate cancer cells to apoptosis during AWT \n The overall goal of these studies is to determine whether dual inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinases epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2 would prolong the effectiveness of this treatment in prostate cancer.  \n The expression of HER2 was demonstrated and quantified in all three tested prostate cancer cell-lines. \n Such features would definitely favor the use of radiometal labels for trastuzumab and, most likely, for affibody molecules \n our data demonstrate that Her2 plays an important role in the support of AR protein stability in the transition of androgen requirement in prostate cancer cells. We hope these findings will provide novel insight into the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. \n These two cell lines exhibited distinct responses to Her2 activation (by heregulin treatment) on Her2 phosphorylation and Her2 inhibition (by AG825 or Herceptin treatments) on proliferation \n  While prostate cancers that express high levels of HER-2 are resistant to the killing effects of trastuzumab, they can be targeted for selective gene expression and destruction by lentiviruses with envelope proteins engineered to bind to this therapeutic antibody \n Overexpression of ErbB-2 and EGFR has been associated with aggressive disease and poor patient prognosis in a range of human tumour types (e.g. breast, lung, ovarian, prostate \n Various approaches have been developed to target the ErbB signalling pathways including monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab/Herceptin \n The data from these in vitro and in vivo studies supported advancement of radiolabeled trastuzumab into two clinical studies \n Tumor targeting was evaluated in mice bearing subcutaneous (s.c.) xenografts of colorectal, pancreatic, ovarian, and prostate carcinomas. \n we found that although prostate cancers that express high levels of HER-2 are resistant to the killing effects of trastuzumab, they can be targeted for selective gene expression and destruction by viruses with envelope proteins engineered to bind this antibody \n detection of prostate cancer (PCa) and advances in hormonal and chemotherapy treatments have provided great clinical benefits to patients with early stages of the disease. \n MAbs directed to established targets include those approved for other solid tumors, including anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) MAb trastuzumab \n We conclude that Her2/neu expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell fraction of prostate cancer patients is frequent and therefore this assay may potentially be useful to detect the presence of micrometastatic disease in men with prostate cancer and for monitoring patients enrolled in trastuzumab-based therapeutic protocols. \n This study suggests that the docetaxel/trastuzumab combination may prove an effective therapeutic approach for HER2-expressing hormone-refractory prostate cancer. \n there was no significant difference in antimetastatic activity between the emulsion and the immunoemulsion despite the affinity of the immunoemulsion towards the HER2 receptor.  \n a targeted drug delivery system based on cationic emulsion covalently linked to anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (Herceptin), in a well-established in vivo pharmacologic model of metastatic prostate cancer that overexpresses the HER2 receptor \n The finding of strong, consistent HER-2/neu expression in ACBCC suggests that treatment with Herceptin (trastuzumab) may be effective in patients with this rare tumour. \n Although HER2 can be over-expressed in prostate cancer, there is no clinical data to support the use of trastuzumab for prostate cancer patients. \n whereas the effect of the trastuzumab-RT combination was inferior to that predicted by the individual effects. \n HER 1-2 targeting of hormone-refractory prostate cancer by ZD1839 and trastuzumab \n Trastuzumab (Herceptin) as a single agent demonstrated poor efficacy in treating HRPC. \n To investigate the efficacy and toxicity of the antibody to the HER-2/neu receptor (trastuzumab, Herceptin) in the treatment of advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) \n Conclusions regarding the predictive value of HER-2 status on outcome after trastuzumab-based therapy were not reached and were only drawn after larger-scale screening efforts.  \n rastuzumab plus docetaxel in HER-2/neu-positive prostate carcinoma \n clinical trials are currently in progress in patients with prostate cancer testing novel agents that selectively interfere with these receptors, such as trastuzumab, \n ytotoxicity of human prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and induction of apoptosis using 213Bi-Herceptin alpha-conjugate \n The clinical interpretation of c-erbB-2 abnormalities should reflect the complexity of c-erbB-2 mediated regulatory pathway and explain why tumours with overexpression/amplification of c-erbB-2 very often do not respond to therapy using Herceptin \n HER-2 overexpression also has been reported in up to 60% of patients with hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma (HRPC) and was correlated with shortened survival \n Unlike breast carcinoma and contrary to prior reports, HER-2 overexpression by IHC in archival prostate tissue from patients who eventually developed hormone-refractory disease was infrequent. There did not appear to be any correlation between HER-2 overexpression by IHC and shed HER-2 antigen levels in serum by ELISA in this tumor type. \n Further development of trastuzumab for the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma is not feasible until more reliable and practical methods of sampling metastatic disease are developed to identify patients with HER-2 positive tumors. \n the expression of ERBB2 in prostate cancer is relatively low, and is not altered during disease progression. Thus, it is unlikely that treatment modalities relying on the overexpression of ERBB2 gene will be useful in treating prostate cancer. \n A phase I study was designed to evaluate docetaxel/estramustine plus trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the HER2 receptor, in patients with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) \n Laboratory evidence also supports the clinical evaluation of docetaxel-based combinations that include agents such as trastuzumab and/or estramustine \n trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody binding to the HER2 receptor; immunotoxin conjugates use an antibody directed against EGFR joined to a cell toxin. All are in clinical trials for a number of cancers, including prostate cancer \n we investigated the antitumor efficacy of Herceptin, a new recombinant humanized anti-HER2/neu antibody, which exhibits cytostatic activity on breast and prostate cancer cells that overexpress the HER2 oncogene. \n trastuzumab was found to have additive and synergistic effects with some chemotherapeutic agents \n ER-2/neu as a therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer \n in these prostate cancer model systems, Herceptin alone has clinical activity only in the androgen-dependent tumor and has at least an additive effect on growth, \n anti-HER2 receptor monoclonal antibody Herceptin significantly enhanced growth inhibition of the MDA PCa 2a cells. \n A phase II clinical trial of trastuzumab and docetaxel with HER2-overexpressing prostate cancer has recently been conducted \n we report the improvement of the docetaxel response of prostate cancer xenografts PAC120 by combination with trastuzumab (Herceptin \n This absence of response to trastuzumab alone has recently been reported in clinical trial in prostate cancer \n This could account for the potentiating effect of trastuzumab on docetaxel in the specific context of prostate cancer cells \n Is the monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab (Herceptin) of potential use in the treatment of prostate cancer?",

        "question": "Absence of TREM2 polymorphisms in patients with Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration \n  These data demonstrate that TREM2 coding region is highly conserved, implying a crucial role of this receptor. Further studies, including a functional analysis, are certainly required to clarify the role of TREM2 in neurodegenerative processes \n Moreover, a rare TREM2 exon 2 variant (p.R47H) was reported to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with an odds ratio as strong as that for APOE\u03b54 \n We observed an enrichment of rare variants across TREM2 in both AD and FTD patients compared to controls, most notably in the extracellular IgV-set domain \n None of the rare variants individually reached significant association, but the frequency of p.R47H was increased ~ 3-fold in both AD and FTD patients compared to controls, in line with previous reports \n Our data corroborate and extend previous findings to include an increased frequency of rare heterozygous TREM2 variations in AD and FTD, and show that TREM2 variants may play a role in neurodegenerative diseases in general. \n non-synonymous genetic rare variant, rs75932628-T (p.R47H), in the TREM2 gene has recently been reported to be a strong genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) \n These data strongly support the important role of p.R47H in AD risk, and suggest that this rare genetic variant is not related to FTD. \n  Higher levels of TREM2 mRNA (p = 0.002) and protein (p < 0.001) were identified in AD patients \n Our results indicate that TREM2 might serve as a novel noninvasive biomarker for AD diagnosis \n studies have identified the rs75932628 (R47H) variant in TREM2 as an Alzheimer's disease risk factor with estimated odds ratio ranging from 2.9 to 5.1 \n This study replicates the association between R47H and Alzheimer's disease risk in a large, population-based sample, and estimates the population frequency and attributable risk of this rare variant \n Moreover, mutation scanning of the five exons of TREM2 failed to detect the presence of novel polymorphisms \n A rare missense mutation (rs75932628-T) in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which was predicted to result in an R47H substitution, was found to confer a significant risk of Alzheimer's disease in Iceland \n We also found that carriers of rs75932628-T between the ages of 80 and 100 years without Alzheimer's disease had poorer cognitive function than noncarriers \n Our findings strongly implicate variant TREM2 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Given the reported antiinflammatory role of TREM2 in the brain, the R47H substitution may lead to an increased predisposition to Alzheimer's disease through impaired containment of inflammatory processes \n rs75932628-T variant of the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has recently been identified as a rare risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) \n These results confirm the association between this variant and AD and underline its involvement in early-onset cases \n recent studies have reported the association of rs75932628-T in the TREM2 gene with the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) \n Rs75932628-T is a rare nonsynonymous variant (p.R47H) that confers a high risk of AD with an effect size similar to that of the APOE \u025b4 allele \n Here, we report the first positive replication study in a Spanish population and confirm that TREM2 rs75932628-T is associated with the risk for AD \n works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), with an odds ratio similar to that of the apolipoprotein E \u03b54 allele \n The reduced function of TREM2 was speculated to be the main cause in the pathogenic effects of this risk variant, and TREM2 is highly expressed in white matter, as well as in the hippocampus and neocortex, which is partly consistent with the pathological features reported in AD brain, indicating the possible involvement of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis \n Emerging evidence has demonstrated that TREM2 could suppress inflammatory response by repression of microglia-mediated cytokine production and secretion, which may prevent inflammation-induced bystander damage of neurons \n TREM2 also participates in the regulation of phagocytic pathways that are responsible for the removal of neuronal debris \n Based on the potential protective actions of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis, targeting TREM2 might provide new opportunities for AD treatment \n Under the hypothesis that low-prevalence variants showing moderate-to-high effect size may be associated with risk for sAD, two independent research groups have demonstrated that a rare variant (rs75932628, encoding a substitution of arginine by histidine at residue 47 (R47H), in the TREM2 gene, which encodes the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) is significantly associated with an increased susceptibility to sAD \n Recently, a novel variant in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has been identified that has refocused the spotlight back onto inflammation as a major contributing factor in AD \n TREM gene cluster, a region recently reported to harbor rare variants that increase AD risk \n evidence suggests that rare genetic variants within the TREM2 gene are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease \n These data suggest that a mutational burden in TREM2 may serve as a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease in general, and that potentially this class of TREM2 variant carriers with dementia should be considered as having a molecularly distinct form of neurodegenerative disease \n The association of TREM2 variants with AD brings innate immune signaling into the light, affirming innate immunity's role as a significant factor in AD pathogenesis \n REM2 variants are associated with Alzheimer's disease risk\nRecently, the unequivocal associations of SNPs within genetic loci that encode genes that function in innate immunity have added genetic support to the notion that innate immunity may have a significant role in AD. \n In addition, a number of other variants in TREM2 were present in AD patients but not controls, with one variant (D87N) showing significant association with disease \n Thus, TREM2 represents the first gene within the innate immune signaling pathway for which functional variants show association with AD risk \n However, some caution is warranted, as inferring both functional effects of these variants on TREM2 and the relationship to the AD pathological cascade is, at this point, largely speculative. The TREM2 R47H and other variants more tentatively associated with AD risk are all located within the extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain of TREM2 \n Thus, similar to the mutations in the same region that cause PLOSL, it is hypothesized that the variants in TREM2 associated with AD cause loss of function or partial loss of function, reducing ligand binding and downstream signaling \n Finally, although the initial focus of TREM2 in AD will likely focus on its role in microglial activation, it is important to consider other possible functional roles of TREM2 on cells other than microglia within the central nervous system and also in regulating peripheral immune cell entry and activity in the brain \n n general, M1 microglial phenotypes have been associated with neurotoxicity and M2 with a neuroprotective/neuro-remodeling role. Based on what we know about TREM2 functions in myeloid cells and the presumed loss of function effects of TREM2 variants associated with AD, one could suggest that the genetic association of TREM2 with AD indicates that suppression of an M2-like neuroprotective microglial response with decreased phagocytosis and increased cytokine production might promote AD pathologies \n If future studies can tie the action of AD-associated TREM2 variants to changes in microglial function that influence AD-relevant phenotypes, there will be direct genetic evidence that alterations in innate immune responses confer risk for AD. \n With the spotlight firmly placed on TREM2's role in AD, research advances will likely be quite rapid, and the emerging data will likely enable a more unified understanding of the function of innate immune signaling in AD. Although the possibility of harnessing TREM2 for therapeutic benefit is tempting, until we learn more about the functionality and regulation of this protein in the brain, it is challenging to envision how one would target TREM2 in AD \n The purpose of this paper is to discuss these recent developments including the potential role that TREM2 normally plays and how loss of function may contribute to AD pathogenesis by enhancing oxidative stress and inflammation within the CNS \n TREM2 in Alzheimer's Disease\n TREM2 function may affect AD pathology through phagocytosis. In a murine model of AD, Frank et al. demonstrated that TREM2 is upregulated in microglia found at the border of amyloid plaque deposits [69]. Moreover, TREM2 expression has been positively correlated with the phagocytic clearance of beta-amyloid in APP transgenic mice \n The strongest evidence to date supporting a role for inflammation in AD comes from two recent studies demonstrating that TREM2 variants increase the risk for AD approximately 3-fold \n In addition, Jonsson and colleagues also showed that elderly carriers of the TREM2 variant who were asymptomatic for AD, nevertheless, performed worse in cognitive exams as compared to noncarriers \n  Interestingly, it is only individuals that are heterozygous for TREM2 that are at risk for AD: homozygous, autosomal recessive mutations for TREM2 result in The Nasu-Hakola disease in some individuals characterized by bone cysts and dementia [75], while resulting in fronttemporal dementia without bone disease in others \n Due to the common thread of dementia in these homozygous mutations, it was these initial findings that spurred further research to search for heterozygous mutations in the TREM2 gene in AD subjects \n Given the prophagocytic role of TREM2, loss of phagocytic activity of microglia could represent one mechanism by which the TREM2 mutations increased the risk to develop AD (Figure 3). Because TREM2 functions in microglia to also dampen microglial activation, mutations and loss of function could result in runaway inflammation as well \n Based on these results, it is tempting to speculate on the potential pharmacological value that TREM2 agonists might have in AD. Future directions should answer this question as well as the possibility of finding more rare variants that have similar effects, including those in DAP12 and TREM2's intracellular signaling partner. \n It has been difficult to assess the cause and effect relationship of inflammation in AD, but the recent discovery of the TREM2 mutations has now put inflammation back on center stage as a process that contributes to disease progression \n This is highlighted by the data indicating an approximate 3-fold increase in the risk for AD in individuals harboring heterozygous variants in the TREM2 gen \n Future studies examining a direct role for TREM2 in AD should help shed light on this question and provide further support for the role of chronic inflammation in this disease. \n Even though we are more at the beginning than at the end of sAD genetics, there is some reason for optimism given the recent identification of novel risk or protective variants (such as rare TREM2 and APP mutations) showing strong statistical associations with sAD \n Under the hypothesis that low-prevalence variants showing moderate-to-high effect size may be associated with the risk for sAD, two independent research groups have demonstrated that a rare variant (rs75932628, encoding a substitution of arginine by histidine at residue 47 (R47H), in the TREM2 gene, which encodes the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) is significantly associated with increased susceptibility to late-onset AD [13,14]. Given the well-known anti-inflammatory role of TREM2 in the brain, it is plausible that the increased risk of late-onset AD associated with the rs75932628 variant may be due to a dysregulation of the inflammatory processes in the central nervous system. \n Although we are more at the beginning than at the end of sAD genetics, optimism prevails given the recent important characterization of novel risk or protective variants (including rare TREM2 and APP mutations) displaying significant statistical associations with sAD \n Is TREM2 associated with Alzheimer's disease?",

        "question": "H1N1 influenza in pregnancy can be associated with severe complications \n This case series confirms a high number of complications in pregnant women due to pandemic H1N1/09. \n Pregnant women might be at increased risk for complications from pandemic H1N1 virus infection. \n Pregnant women are at increased risk for complications from pandemic influenza H1N1 virus infection.  \n Vaccination of pregnant women against influenza A (H1N1) by Russian subunit formulation (MonoGrippol plus) showed reactogenicity comparable to control group by the level of influence on general metabolic and immunologic homeostasis and on the course of pregnancy, which is an evidence of its safety \n Pregnancy was identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to H1N1 influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010 \n While it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively if myocarditis was caused by either infection with H1N1 virus or as a result of pregnancy (in the absence of endomyocardial biopsies), the significant association with myocardial involvement in both women demonstrates the increased risk of exposure to H1N1 influenza virus in pregnant women. \n Although limited in size, the fully prospective nature of the safety follow-up of these women vaccinated during pregnancy is unique and offers an important degree of reassurance for the use of the AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 (2009) vaccine in this high risk group for H1N1 infection. \n During the H1N1 2009 pandemic, pregnant women constituted one of the priority groups for vaccination in many countries, creating a need for close monitoring of the safety of the vaccine in pregnant women \n Emerging data suggest that pregnancy conveys high risk for severe complications from the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (2009 H1N1) infection \n Pregnant women have been identified as a group at risk, both for respiratory complications than for the admissions to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic \n This report mitigates substantially the presumed severity of pandemic H1N1/09 influenza infection during pregnancy \n The results of our study do not indicate a risk for the pregnant woman and the developing embryo/fetus after H1N1 vaccination \n This large cohort study found no evidence of an increased risk of fetal death associated with exposure to an adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine during pregnancy \n Our results suggest that second- or third-trimester H1N1 vaccination was associated with improved fetal and neonatal outcomes during the recent pandemic \n Pregnant women might thus be at increased risk of complications from pandemic H1N1 virus infection, and illness may progress rapidly \n Pregnant women with H1N1 infection seem to benefit from antiviral therapy. \n arly identification and treatment were the most important factors in different countries and areas examined. \n The vaccine and antiviral drugs that have been the most efficient means to control the novel virus appear to be safe but require more extensive study \n However, there were significant differences between the two groups in relation to mean age, treatment with oseltamivir, schooling, and presence of other risk factors \n To investigate whether exposure to an adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes. \n In this Danish cohort, exposure to an adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine during pregnancy was not associated with a significantly increased risk of major birth defects, preterm birth, or fetal growth restriction \n Most people affected by the virus, including pregnant women, suffer a mild viral illness, and make a full recovery \n Pregnant women, because of their altered immunity and physiological adaptations, are at higher risk of developing pulmonary complications, especially in the second and third trimesters \n The pregnancy outcomes were also poor for women who were affected by the virus with a fivefold increase in the perinatal mortality rate and threefold increase in the preterm delivery rate \n regnant women were at increased risk for serious outcomes of 2009 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (influenza A[H1N1]pdm09) infection, but little is known about the overall impact of the pandemic on neonatal and maternal outcomes \n In this large, geographically diverse population, A(H1N1)pdm09 infection increased the risk for hospitalization during pregnancy \n Vaccination during pregnancy with Pandemrix(\u00ae) appeared to have no ill effects on the pregnancy. On the contrary, the rate of preterm birth and low birthweight was lower than expected, which agrees with some previous results \n During the influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 pandemic, although many cases occurred in younger adults, the risk factors identified for severe infections and complications were similar to those for seasonal influenza, including chronic respiratory, renal, liver, and heart diseases. \n In terms of pregnancy, the studies have shown contradictory results due to variations in methodology and medical care. \n However, it seems that pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester, increases the risk of complications, and that early antiviral treatment is associated with improved outcomes. \n Pregnant women with mild clinical illness secondary to 2009 H1N1 were not at a greater risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes \n However, severely infected women were more likely to deliver SGA infants \n Gestational age is associated with the risk of developing critical infection. The risk increases with increasing weeks of gestation. \n  Following the start of winter in Liaoning province in China, the number of pregnant women infected with influenza increased significantly \n regnancy, with or without additional complications, constitutes a high-risk condition for complications of influenza infection and warrants early intervention with neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, if influenza is suspected \n There are also reports of an increased risk of miscarriage, birth defect, and preterm delivery when pregnancy is associated with influenza infection \n Most patients who were pregnant (95%) were in the second or third trimester, and approximately one-third (34%) had established risk factors for complications from influenza other than pregnancy. As compared with early antiviral treatment (administered before or at two days after symptom onset) in pregnant women, later treatment was associated with admission to an intensive care unit or death (relative risk, 4.3). \n Although influenza virus is a rare but recognized cause of myocarditis and pregnancy is a known risk factor for the development of peri-partum cardiomyopathy, the association of H1N1-associated severe viral pneumonia combined with features of troponin negative myocarditis and cardiomyopathy in our two consecutive patients raises the novel and hitherto unreported association between H1N1 infection and myocardial involvement which increases the risk significantly for pregnant women. \n No study to date has demonstrated an increased risk of either maternal complications or adverse fetal outcomes associated with inactivated influenza vaccination.  \n These two cases of H1N1 infection in relatively normal pregnant women illustrate the increased risk of life-threatening complications (including myocarditis and cardiomyopathy) in this group and the multi-system involvement seen. \n In this context suggesting enhanced virulence for this novel influenza strain, further supported by alveolar damage in animal models reminiscent of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian viruses [10]\u2013[12], pregnant women, who exhibited higher case-fatality-ratios (CFR) in past influenza pandemics [13], [14], but also increased admission rates to hospital in seasonal flu [15], have been stressed as a high-risk population for pdm influenza \n Additionally, in the USA, pregnant women for whom oseltamivir was delayed beyond 48 hrs carried a four-fold risk to be admitted in the ICU and a 30-fold risk to die [18], whilst the high cause-specific maternal CFR anticipated that 2009 H1N1 influenza could increase the 2009 maternal mortality ratio in the country \n The risk factors for severe pdm influenza (defined as pneumonia or severe asthma) are presented in Table 4 \n Compared to non pregnant women of reproductive age (15\u201344 yrs) seen in the ED, hospitalized pdm flu pregnant women carried not an excess risk of pneumonia (6/84 vs 7/109, crude RR: 1.1, 95% CI: 0.5\u20132.0), or to be admitted to the ICU  \n Our findings, acquired without major selection bias nor critical strain on the healthcare supply, mitigate historical and recent disturbing data on severe pdm influenza in pregnant women highlighting increased risks for hospitalization or admission to the ICU \n ndeed, with only 11,000 ongoing pregnancies, a crude estimate of influenza-related critical illness in Australasia about 1\u22364,300 gestations (66 ICU stays for 285,000 ongoing pregnancies), we were unable to show the role of pregnancy as a risk factor for influenza-related critical illness in La R\u00e9union \n Pregnant women are at higher risk of morbidity from seasonal influenza infection, and studies from previous pandemics have found that influenza infection in pregnancy is associated with increased mortality \n Early in the outbreak of pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza reports suggested a high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with infection in pregnancy \n The few studies dealing with fetal risks associated with pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine in pregnancy have relied on passive pharmacovigilance surveillance or designs without control groups. \n Although the data have not indicated an increased risk, the designs of these studies have precluded an adequate analytical approach and they have therefore not been able to exclude risks to the fetus \n We carried out a nationwide register based cohort study to investigate whether there was an increased risk of fetal death (spontaneous abortion and stillbirth) after vaccination with an AS03 adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine among pregnant women in Denmark \n Common contraindications to vaccination (for example, acute (febrile) illness) may also be associated with an increased risk of fetal death; this would bias results towards a protective effect of vaccination, at least in the period immediately after vaccination \n We also estimated the risk of stillbirth, including smoking status and prepregnancy body mass index, in the propensity score (these data, from the medical birth register, were available only for stillborn and live born infants).  \n The risk of fetal death associated with H1N1 vaccination in pregnancy was not increased in either unadjusted (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.20) or adjusted analyses \n here was a non-significant decreased risk of fetal death in the two week period immediately after vaccination (six exposed cases; adjusted hazard ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.22 to 1.10) \n Association between vaccination against pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza in pregnancy and risk of fetal death in nationwide cohort of 54 585 pregnancies in Denmark \n No increased risk of spontaneous abortion was observed after H1N1 vaccination in either unadjusted (hazard ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 1.80) or adjusted analyses \n There was a non-significant decreased risk of spontaneous abortion in the two week period immediately after vaccination \n The risk of stillbirth after H1N1 vaccination decreased in both unadjusted (hazard ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.20 to 0.92) and adjusted analyses \n There was no significantly decreased risk of stillbirth in the two week period after vaccination (one exposed case; adjusted hazard ratio 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.08 to 4.18) \n The risk of fetal death was estimated in pregnant women with and without any registered predefined comorbidities: hazard ratios were similar in these two groups \n In analyses of fetal death according to trimester of vaccination, the risk associated with vaccination in the first trimester was not significantly increased (table 3); there was a significantly decreased risk associated with vaccination in the second trimester and no significantly increased risk associated with vaccination in the third \n A confounder that would mask a true risk associated with vaccination would be of primary concern; it was therefore assumed that those receiving vaccination had a lower prevalence of an unmeasured confounder that was associated with increased risk of fetal death \n \nIn this large nationwide cohort study, vaccination with an AS03 adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine in pregnancy was not associated with an increased risk of the primary composite outcome of fetal death, or its components spontaneous abortion and stillbirth. Given the upper limit of the confidence interval, these data allowed the exclusion of a 17% increased risk of fetal death, a 74% increased risk of spontaneous abortion, and any risk of stillbirth associated with vaccination \n Thus our cohort study confirms the findings from limited previous reports and expands on these findings by providing the first detailed comparative analysis of the risk of fetal death associated with H1N1 vaccination \n In a scenario where a true increased risk of fetal death associated with vaccination exists, an increased risk of fetal death conferred by H1N1 infection itself among unvaccinated women might have biased results towards the null \n Several factors need to be considered when interpreting our finding of a significantly decreased risk of stillbirth associated with vaccination against H1N1 influenza. Although H1N1 infection is associated with an increased risk of stillbirth,36 and a protective effect of vaccination therefore may seem plausible, the objective of our study was to investigate a possible increased risk of adverse events. \n In conclusion, this nationwide study is the first to analytically investigate fetal risks associated with vaccination against pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza in pregnancy. \n Pregnant women infected with pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza were at increased risk of morbidity, mortality, and poor pregnancy outcomesIn many countries, the H1N1 vaccination campaigns included pregnant women among the target groupsWhat this study addsIn a cohort of over 50\u2009000 pregnancies in Denmark, there was no increased risk of the composite outcome of fetal death and its components, spontaneous abortion and stillbirth, associated with exposure to an adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine \n Is pregnancy an additional risk during during H1N1 infection?",

        "question": "Patients with chronic heart failure and subclinical hypothyroidism significantly improved their physical performance when normal TSH levels were reached. \n Early and sustained physiological restoration of circulating L-T3 levels after MI halves infarct scar size and prevents the progression towards heart failure. This beneficial effect is likely due to enhanced capillary formation and mitochondrial protection. \n These data indicate that T(3) replacement to euthyroid levels improves systolic function and tends to improve diastolic function, potentially through changes in myocardial gene expression. \n In these patients, the administration of synthetic triiodothyronine (T(3)) was well tolerated and induced significant improvement in cardiac function without increased heart rate and metabolic demand. \n In DC patients, short-term synthetic L-T(3) replacement therapy significantly improved neuroendocrine profile and ventricular performance. \n Triiodothyronine was well tolerated without episodes of ischemia or clinical arrhythmia. There was no significant change in heart rate or metabolic rate and there was minimal increase in core temperature. Cardiac output increased with a reduction in systemic vascular resistance in patients receiving the largest dose, consistent with a peripheral vasodilatory effect. \n Is thyroid hormone therapy indicated in patients with heart failure?",

        "question": "The results showed that higher levels of TSH within the reference range were independently associated with the presence of CAD only among subjects less than or equal to 65 years old, suggesting age might influence the relationship. \n FT3 levels within the normal range were inversely correlated with the presence and severity of CAD. Moreover, lower FT3 concentrations were correlated with the Gensini score and independently predicted the presence and severity of CAD. \n High TSH within the reference range was associated with increased risk of coronary death in women (P(trend) 0\u00b7005), but not in men. The risk of coronary death was also increased among women with subclinical hypothyroidism or subclinical hyperthyroidism, compared to women with TSH of 0\u00b750-1\u00b74 mU/l.  \n  Prevalence of CHD was more common in hypothyroid and moderate SCH patients. \n The angiographic results were as follows: significant coronary disease (SH 28.1% vs. non-SH 43.8%; p=0.087); three-vessel disease (9.4% vs. 9.9%; p=0.919); two-vessel disease (12.5% vs. 13.4%; p=0.892); single-vessel disease (6.3% vs. 29.5%; p=0.051); minimal lesions (9.4% vs. 10.9%; p=0.794); and no coronary disease (62.4% vs, 45.3%; p=0.064). \n Lower fT3 levels were predictive of both single-vessel (p = 0.012) and multivessel (p = 0.009) CAD. Through a multivariate logistic regression analysis, fT3 was still linked to the presence of CAD (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.34-0.68, p < 0.001). \n Our study showed that FT(4) levels were associated with the presence and the severity of CAD. Also, this study suggests that elevated serum FT(4) levels even within normal range could be a risk factor for CAD.  \n The present meta-analysis indicates that sub-clinical hypothyroidism is associated with both, a significant risk of CHD at baseline and at follow-up. \n The incidence of multi-vessel disease was higher in patients with high TSH level (p=0.026). TSH level showed a significant correlation with age (r=0.109, p=0.044) and Gensini's score (r=0.117, p=0.045). The multivariate analysis revealed that age (OR 2.39, p=0.001), diabetes (OR 3.74, p=0.001), creatinine (OR 2.06, p=0.008), and smoking (OR 1.85, p=0.045) were independent predictors for significant coronary artery disease, but TSH level did not predict coronary artery stenosis. \n These data in patients referred for coronary angiography suggest that variation of thyroid function within the statistical normal range may influence the presence and severity of coronary atherosclerosis. \n Is there a relationship between thyroid hormone altered metabolism and coronary artery disease?",

This increase could be partially attributed to cardiac stress. \n Increases in NT-proBNP can be found in a major part of obviously healthy athletes after prolonged strenuous exercise. The release of BNP during and after exercise may not result from myocardial damage but may have cytoprotective and growth-regulating effects. The different nature of exercise-induced increases in BNP and cardiac troponins has to be elucidated in the future. \n In healthy cyclists, transient increases in NT-pro-BNP and cTnT are more likely to reflect cardiac fatigue than injury. \n The rise in BNP in older athletes may reflect a reversible, mainly diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.  \n Plasma BNP concentrations were higher in both the judo and marathon groups than in controls, and positively correlated with LV mass as well as with deceleration time. \n Such exercise significantly increased ANP and BNP levels in healthy men, and the increases could be partially attributed to myocardial damage during the race. \n Does BNP increase after intensive exercise in athletes?",

PTPN22 gene polymorphism, C5/TRAF1 genes region polymorphism and TNFAIP3-OLIG3 genes region polymorphism(s) are among newly identified and already confirmed genetic risk factors, whereas STAT 4, CTLA4, PADI4 and IRF5 genes polymorphisms are listed among probable RA development genetic risk factors \n Patients were analysed for anti-MCV and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), and were genotyped for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 \"shared epitope\" (SE) and protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) 1858T \n As well as the major susceptibility gene HLA-DRB1, recent genome-wide and candidate-gene studies reported additional evidence for association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5 loci with RA \n However, we were able to replicate the association signals between RA and HLA-DRB1 alleles, STAT4 (rs7574865), PTPN22 (rs2476601) and OLIG3/TNFAIP3 (rs10499194 and rs6920220) \n Additionally, SNPs rs7574865STAT4 (P = 9.2*10-6; OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.35 - 2.18) and rs2476601PTPN22 (P = 9.5*10-4; OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.23 - 2.26) were associated with susceptibility to RA, whereas after permutation testing OLIG3/TNFAIP3 SNPs rs10499194 and rs6920220 missed our criteria for significance (Pcorr = 0.114 and Pcorr = 0.180, respectively \n In our Slovak population, HLA-DRB1 alleles as well as SNPs in STAT4 and PTPN22 genes showed a strong association with RA \n Currently, 5 loci (HLA, PTPN22, TRAF1/C5, TNFAIP3, and STAT4) have been consistently reported, whereas others have been observed less systematically \n Genetic markers such as shared epitope alleles and PTPN22 1858T variant increase the relative risk for disease development \n Particularly, ACPAs in combination with human leukocyte antigen-shared epitope alleles and PTPN22 1858T carriage increased the relative risks of developing RA compared with not having these factors \n However, inconsistent results of the contributions of non-HLA susceptibility genes have been described, with the exception of a few genes repeatedly associated with RA-susceptibility, such as PTPN22 gene in populations of European ancestry and PADI4 gene in populations of Asian ancestry, revealing the presence of genetic heterogeneity in RA \n Functional polymorphisms of PTPN22 and FcgR genes in Tunisian patients with rheumatoid arthritis \n We found strong evidence of an association of PTPN22 620W allele and RA \n In conclusion, we have confirmed that PTPN22 620W allele is associated with Tunisian RA but does not constitute a factor influencing clinical manifestations \n The C1858T allele of the PTPN22 gene has been reported to confer risk for RA \n Similarly, the presence or absence of the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope or the RA-associated PTPN22 allele had no influence on this association \n Although some genetic risk factors for RA are well-established, most notably HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22, these markers do not fully account for the observed heritability \n Lastly, in combination with the other two known genetic risk factors, HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22, the variants reported here generate more than a 45-fold RA-risk differential \n Contribution of PTPN22 1858T, TNFRII 196R and HLA-shared epitope alleles with rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies to very early rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis \n PTPN22 1858T, TNFRII 196R and HLA-SE alleles do not improve the predictive value of RF and ACPA for RA diagnosis in our cohort, and do not contribute to an earlier diagnosis in undifferentiated patients initially negative for RF and ACPA \n In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) recently performed in 774 anti-CCP negative RA patients, 1147 anti-CCP positive RA patients and 1079 common controls,15 no SNP achieved genome-wide significance in the comparison between anti-CCP negative RA and controls, while the PTPN22 gene was associated with anti-CCP positive RA, together with hundreds of SNPs located within the HLA locus on chromosome 6 \n Three other markers at AFF3, CD28, PTPN22 and two at the TNFAIP3 locus reached genome-wide significance (<5E-08) in anti-CCP positive RA with OR of 1.17, 1.18, 1.91, 1.29 and 1.45, respectively.  \n This allows the classification of the loci into three distinct categories (table 3 and figure 1): the HLA-DRB1 SE, PTPN22 and one marker at TNFAIP3 are associated with anti-CCP positive and negative RA, but show a clear differential association with an effect size significantly higher in anti-CCP positive RA (category 1) \n Markers with highly significant associations and effect size ratio like PTPN22 can be considered as accurately categorised. \n One of the SNPs is located within PTPN22 \n We further characterize the expression and function of PTPN22.6, and explore its clinical applications in RA \n It is likely that the elevated level of PTPN22.6 seen in our RA patients with higher disease activity is contributed by one single or a few subsets of blood cells \n Despite the positive correlation between the level of PTPN22.6 and RA activity, it needs to be mentioned that we measured the level of PTPN22 isoforms in peripheral blood instead of purified cell populations \n It is also unclear whether the elevated level of PTPN22.6 is a cause or an epiphenomenon of higher RA activity. Prospective studies longitudinally monitoring the level of PTPN22.6 in RA patients will be needed to address this important question. \n The expression of PTPN22.6 varies significantly among healthy individuals. It will be of great interest to investigate in the future whether T cells obtained from individuals expressing a high level of PTPN22.6, such as donor#3, will be hyper-responsive to stimulation \n The SNPs were markers associated with RA susceptibility in cohorts tested by our group and others and consisted of: rs1160542 (AFF3), rs2812378 (CCL21), rs763361 (CD226), rs4810485 (CD40), rs3087243 and rs231775 (CTLA4), rs6822844 (IL2/IL21), rs2104286 (IL2RA), rs743777 (IL2RB), rs1678542 (KIF5A), rs4750316 (PRKCQ), rs7574865 (STAT4), rs13207033, rs5029937 and rs6920220 (6q23), rs10760130 and rs2900180 (TRAF1/C5) and rs2476601 (PTPN22). \n The well-established RA susceptibility SNP within PTPN22 (rs2476601) appeared not to associate with RA in patients from Crete, Greece. This might be owing to a lack of power resulting from small sample size. \n There remains no supportive evidence for a significant effect at the PTPN22 locus in South-Eastern European patients with RA. \n Approximately 40% of genetic susceptibility to RA is accounted for by the HLA-DRB1 alleles encoding the shared epitope (SE), the major RA susceptibility locus [3], together with the protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 22 gene (PTPN22), a second susceptibility gene confirmed in populations of northern European ancestry  \n The present study focuses on five confirmed RA susceptibility genes/loci - HLA-DRB1 (6p21), PTPN22 (1p13), OLIG3/TNFAIP3 (6q23), STAT4 (2q32) and TRAF1/C5 (9q33) - that are associated with RA with low-to-moderate risk in UK patients \n The aim of the current study was to determine whether the previously reported RA susceptibility genes/loci (HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, OLIG3/TNFAIP3, STAT4 and TRAF1/C5) were associated with RA in an inception cohort.  \n .Association of HLA-DRB1 SE, PTPN22, OLIG3/TNFAIP3, STAT4 and TRAF1/C5 with RA susceptibilityIn the total RA inception cohort (n = 1,046), an initial model-free analysis of genotype frequencies was performed by undertaking a 3\u00d7 2 analysis. The global P values for each genetic locus are as follows: HLA-DRB1 SE alleles, P < 1 \u00d7 10-6 (n = 968); PTPN22, P = 2 \u00d7 10-6 (n = 855); OLIG3/TNFAIP3, P = 0.030 (n = 810); STAT4, P = 0.035 (n = 767); and TRAF1/C5, P = 0.041 (n = 763). \n There was no evidence that HLA-DRB1 SE, PTPN22, OLIG3/TNFAIP3, STAT4 or TRAF1/C5 were significantly associated with prevalent erosions in logistic regression analyses of the total RA cohort, after adjustment for symptom duration \n In the present study we confirmed that the HLA-DRB1 SE, PTPN22 and the OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5 loci were associated with susceptibility to RA in an inception cohort. \n Indeed, only PTPN22 demonstrated any suggestion of association with RA in the autoantibody-negative cohort, which warrants further investigation in a larger inception cohort.\n \n Power calculations based on replicating the association of PTPN22 with autoantibody-negative disease with an effect size in the range 1.2 to 1.5 revealed that 2,909 cases would be required if one control per case was used, reducing to 2,169 if two controls per case were used. \n The influence of HLA\u2013DRB1 and PTPN22*1858T phenotypes on mortality risk was similar in the entire IP cohort and in the subgroup who satisfied the ACR criteria for RA by 10 years  \n Our data confirm that the PTPN22 R620W polymorphism is a strong risk factor for RF-positive RA, and that presence of this polymorphism interacts with heavy cigarette smoking in a multiplicative manner. These findings contribute to the growing understanding of how genetic and environmental factors interact in RA pathogenesis, and suggest that heavy cigarette smoking and PTPN22 may be acting in a similar mechanistic pathway \n The newly described interaction between PTPN22 and heavy cigarette smoking suggests that the smoking/citrullination/T-cell recognition and activation pathway in RA pathogenesis may be influenced by both PTPN22 and HLA-SE \n  Several reports and a meta-analysis have suggested that those with the PTPN22 risk allele have more severe disease \n The results of their study are slightly different from ours, in that they did not find a significant interaction between the presence of the PTPN22 polymorphism and smoking in determining RA risk. \n  Both HLA-SE and PTPN22 primarily affect the risk for RF-positive and anti-CCP-positive RA  \n  However, we did uncover a significant multiplicative gene-environment interaction between heavy smoking and PTPN22 in determining RA risk \n In these two cohorts of women followed prospectively for the development of RA and for multiple potential environmental exposures, we have confirmed that the R620W polymorphism in the PTPN22 gene is associated with increased risk for RA \n The risk for RA associated with the PTPN22 variant T allele was elevated \n We aimed to validate previous findings of increased risk for RA associated with polymorphisms in the PTPN22 \n RA genetic studies have reported polymorphisms PTPN22 (R620W, rs2476601) [9,11-16], CTLA-4 (CT60, rs3087243) [17,18], and PADI-4 (PADI4_94, rs2240340) [8] to be associated with increased risk for RA. \n We previously reported the identity of the RA-associated PTPN22 R620W variant which was discovered in the first step \n Combining genetic information from HLA, PTPN22 and TRAF1 variants, we calculate the posterior probability of RA for every possible genotype combination. Results such as these may form the foundation for individualized prognosis and targeted medicine \n As the R620W missense polymorphism in PTPN22 appears to have stronger susceptibility effects for RF-positive disease \n Multi-Locus RA Risk CalculationsGiven that we have begun to witness the application of associated genetic variants to disease prognosis [42],[43] and thus far we have convincing evidence for three RA-predisposing loci in our studies (HLA-DRB1, PTPN22 and the TRAF1 region), we estimated the risk of RA given genotypes at these three loci under three different possible unconditional RA risk assumptions (i.e. RA disease prevalence values) using Bayes' theorem \n The well studied associations with HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22 explain about 50% of the genetic contribution to RA disease susceptibility \n We analyzed six SNPs with prior evidence of association with RA in genome-wide association studies and candidate-gene approaches, namely in or near the genes PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3, and TRAF1/C5 \n Here, we found significant association to RA risk for PTPN22 variant rs2476601 and HLA-DRB1 alleles in anti-CCP-positive RA patients compared with OA controls \n Our study demonstrates strong evidence that polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, and STAT4 genes contribute to RA susceptibility in a comprehensively characterized Slovak case population compared with a gender-matched OA control group \n The most significant SNP, rs2476601, is located on chromosome 1 less than 1 Mb from the PTPN22 gene, which has been shown to be associated with RA \n Is the PTPN22 gene a biomarker for Rheumatoid Arthritis?",

        "question": "Despite the fact that bariatric surgery-induced weight loss is associated with a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality and improvement in renal function, bariatric surgery has recently been shown to be associated with a significant risk of nephrolithiasis. The main risk factor for nephrolithiasis is increased excretion of urinary oxalate. \n Our study confirms the risk of urinary stones following the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure as a result of hyperoxaluria, low urine volume and hypocitraturia.  \n A controlled metabolic diet normal in calcium, moderate in protein, and reduced in oxalate can positively affect urinary CaOx supersaturation after bariatric surgery. However, this diet did not appear to decrease urinary oxalate excretion.  \n Hyperoxaluria and increased calcium oxalate stone formation occur after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery for morbid obesity.  \n Therefore, after bariatric surgery, increases in fecal fat excretion, urinary oxalate excretion after an oral oxalate load, plasma oxalate, and urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation values were observed. \n Bariatric surgery (BS) may be associated with increased oxalate excretion and a higher risk of nephrolithiasis.  \n The mean oxaluric response to an oxalate load is markedly elevated in post-bariatric surgery patients, suggesting that increased intestinal absorption of dietary oxalate is a predisposing mechanism for enteric hyperoxaluria. \n Persistent mild to moderate hyperoxaluria (PMMH) is a common side effect of bariatric surgery.  \n This prospective study indicates that RYGB is associated with an earlier increase in urinary oxalate excretion and relative supersaturation of calcium oxalate than previously reported. \n Hyperoxaluria in kidney stone formers treated with modern bariatric surgery. \n Hyperoxaluria is the most significant abnormality of urine chemistry studies in patients with kidney stones who have undergone bariatric surgery.  \n Recent investigations have shown increased oxalate excretion in patients in whom kidney stones formed after contemporary bariatric surgery. \n There is a high prevalence of hyperoxaluria in patients without a history of kidney stones who undergo bariatric surgery.

        "question": " Thus far, results from two large phase 3 trial programs with bapineuzumab and solaneuzumab, respectively, have brought rather disappointing results. \n More recently, in phase III studies, bapineuzumab has been discontinued because it did not prove clinically effective (despite its significant effect on biomarkers), while solaneuzumab has been found effective in slowing AD progression.  \n Passive immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against A\u03b2 is in late clinical development but recently the two most advanced mAbs, Bapineuzumab and Solanezumab, targeting an N-terminal or central epitope, respectively, failed to meet their target of improving or stabilizing cognition and function. \n The marginal effects observed in recent clinical studies of solanezumab, targeting monomeric A\u03b2, and bapineuzumab, targeting amyloid plaques, prompted expert comments that drug discovery efforts in Alzheimer's disease should focus on soluble forms of A\u03b2 rather than fibrillar A\u03b2 deposits found in amyloid plaques. \n Phase III trials showed that bapineuzumab failed to improve cognitive and functional performances in AD patients, and was associated with a high incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). \n Clinical trials on various drugs, including AN1792, bapineuzumab, and solanezumab, have been carried out; however, all trials have failed to demonstrate apparent clinical benefits.  \n Despite the alteration in biochemical composition, all 3 immunized subjects exhibited continued cognitive decline. \n Despite negative topline phase 3 clinical trial results for bapineuzumab and solanezumab in mild to moderate AD, findings from these trials and recent advances suggest renewed optimism for anti-amyloid therapies.  \n The lack of progress in the development of disease-modifying therapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) was highlighted recently by the cessation of a phase 3 clinical trial studying the effects of bapineuzumab on mild to moderate disease. No treatment benefit was apparent, whereas several serious side effects occurred more commonly in the treatment group compared to placebo.  \n Clinical studies using the N-terminal-directed anti-A\u03b2 antibody bapineuzumab have demonstrated reduced brain PET-Pittsburg-B signals, suggesting the reduction of A\u03b2 plaques, and reduced levels of total and phosphorylated tau protein in the CSF of treated AD patients. Preclinical studies using 3D6 (the murine form of bapineuzumab) have demonstrated resolution of A\u03b2 plaque and vascular burdens, neuritic dystrophy, and preservation of synaptic density in the transgenic APP mouse models. \n The clinical results of the initial studies with bapineuzumab were equivocal in terms of cognitive benefit. The occurrence of vasogenic edema after bapineuzumab, and more rarely brain microhemorrhages (especially in Apo E \u03b54 carriers), has raised concerns on the safety of these antibodies directed against the N-terminus of the A\u03b2 peptide.  \n  The most advanced of these immunological approaches is bapineuzumab, composed of humanized anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies, that has been tested in two Phase II trials, demonstrating to reduce A\u03b2 burden in the brain of AD patients. However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab appears uncertain. The occurrence of vasogenic edema, especially in apolipoprotein E 4 carriers, may limit its clinical use and have led to abandon the highest dose of the drug (2 mg/kg). \n However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibody, appears uncertain. Moreover, the occurrence of vasogenic edema and, more rarely, brain microhemorrhages, especially in apolipoprotein E \u03f54 carriers, have led to abandoning of the highest dose of the drug.  \n However, the preliminary equivocal cognitive results obtained with bapineuzumab as well as the detrimental cognitive effects observed with semagacestat, a potent \u03b3-secretase inhibitor, raise the possibility that targeting A\u03b2 may not be clinically efficacious in AD.  \n The patient received four bapineuzumab infusions over a 39 week period. During the course of this treatment, there was no remarkable change in cognitive impairment as determined by MMSE scores. Forty-eight days after the fourth bapineuzumab infusion was given, MRI revealed that the patient had developed lacunar infarcts and possible vasogenic edema, probably related to immunotherapy, but a subsequent MRI scan 38 days later demonstrated resolution of vasogenic edema. The patient expired due to acute congestive heart failure complicated by progressive AD and cerebrovascular accident 378 days after the first bapineuzumab infusion and 107 days after the end of therapy. Neuropathological and biochemical analysis did not produce evidence of lasting plaque regression or clearance of A\u03b2 due to immunotherapy. \n These results suggest that, in this particular case, bapineuzumab immunotherapy neither resulted in detectable clearance of amyloid plaques nor prevented further cognitive impairment. \n Bapineuzumab has been shown to reduce A\u03b2 burden in the brain of AD patients. However, its preliminary cognitive efficacy appears uncertain, particularly in ApoE \u03b54 carriers, and vasogenic edema may limit its clinical use.  \n Bapineuzumab appears capable of reducing the cerebral beta-amyloid peptide burden in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, particularly in APOE 4 carriers, its ability to slow disease progression remains uncertain, and vasogenic edema - a dose-limiting and potentially severe adverse reaction - may limit its clinical applicability. \n The first is a phase 2 study of passive immunotherapy with bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody directed against the N-terminus of Abeta. This trial showed no differences within dose cohorts on the primary efficacy analysis. Exploratory analyses showed potential treatment differences on cognitive and functional endpoints in study completers and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 noncarriers. A safety concern was the occurrence of reversible vasogenic edema.  \n The first passive immunotherapy trial with bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the end terminus of Abeta, also encountered some dose dependent adverse events during the Phase II portion of the study, vasogenic edema in 12 cases, which were significantly over represented in ApoE4 carriers. \n No significant differences were found in the primary efficacy analysis.\nExploratory analyses, however, showed potential treatment differences on cognitive and functional endpoints in study completers and apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 noncarriers. In this subgroup, subjects on active treatment showed 5 points less decline on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale for Cognition after 78 weeks compared with placebo. A safety concern was the occurrence of reversible vasogenic edema, detected on brain magnetic resonance imaging in 10% of the bapineuzumab-treated patients.  \n The bapineuzumab trial showed that intravenous administration of the serial bapineuzumab doses is feasible and, as long as the possible occurrence of vasogenic edema is monitored, is relatively safe. The positron emission tomography substudy provided the suggestion that bapineuzumab indeed reduces amyloid load in vivo. The lack of effect on the primary endpoint of the trial may be due to the fact that, as the authors point out, it was underpowered to show small differences in efficacy. \n Although passive and active immunotherapies have been effective in the removal of A\u03b2 in A\u03b2PP and PS Tg mice models, the application of these interventions to AD patients has been only partially successful from a neuropathological perspective [5]\u2013[9], while no clear beneficial modification of the disease course has been observed in clinical trials [7], [10], [11] \n About 1 month after the last dose, the patient showed symptoms and signs of vasogenic edema on an MRI scan that was cleared prior to her death. There were no apparent signs of disease modification that could be attributed to the immunotherapy treatment.  \n MRI scans were completed for safety assessment 6 weeks after each infusion and acute vasogenic edema was observed on the safety scan at 6 weeks following the second infusion. Progressive cognitive decline occurred with a MMSE of 8/30 measured just 6 months prior to death.  \n Bapineuzumab immunotherapy induces brain effusive vasogenic edema defined as Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA-E) and microhemorrhages (ARIA-H) in AD individuals [36].  \n Although clinical trials of ponezumab, bapineuzumab and solanezumab for mild and moderate AD were halted or did not achieve their primary end points [11], [85], [86], other clinical trials using a variety of immune approaches are still being evaluated. \n In Summer 2012, the sponsors of the Bapineuzumab Phase III clinical trial reported disappointing results and the discontinuation of all but one subcutaneous clinical trial [40]. In detail, the studies involving ApoE4 carriers and non-carriers failed to show any significant benefit on cognition or functional performance, even though positive effects on the secondary biomarker endpoints (cerebral amyloid burden and CSF phospho-tau) were found. ARIA, seizures and deaths occurred more frequently [41-43]. \n Is bapineuzumab effective for treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease?",

The expression of p21 and c-myc was also altered in certain cell lines. \n In particular, the proto-oncogene c-Myc has been documented to be under circadian regulation. \n The circadian expression of c-MYC is modulated by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A in synchronized murine neuroblastoma cells. \n Our results, using the murine neuroblastoma cell line N2A, show that Per1 and c-Myc steady-state mRNA levels oscillate with the same phase. \n These experiments demonstrate for the first time that a significant decrease in c-Myc transcript and protein levels can be achieved after a short TSA treatment applied only at specific circadian times. This is also followed by a reduction in the proliferation rate of the cell population. \n Among the circadian output pathways, the rhythmic sympathetic signaling plays a key role in the central-peripheral timing mechanism that simultaneously activates the cell cycle clock via AP1-controlled Myc induction and p53 via peripheral clock-controlled ATM activation. \n Jet-lag promptly desynchronizes the central clock-SNS-peripheral clock axis, abolishes the peripheral clock-dependent ATM activation, and activates myc oncogenic potential, leading to tumor development in the same organ systems in wild-type and circadian gene-mutant mice. \n The results showed that over-expression of Per2 induced not only cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase but also an increase in apoptosis, which was confirmed by characteristic morphological changes, FCM and evident DNA fragmentation.

Moreover, we demonstrated that the direct interaction of these two proteins resulted in the inhibition of the deacetylase activity of HDAC6. \n Finally, we demonstrated that, similarly to other HDAC6 inhibitors, TPPP/p25 influences the microtubule dynamics by decreasing the growth velocity of the microtubule plus ends and also affects cell motility as demonstrated by time lapse video experiments. \n \"tubacin,\" which inhibits alpha-tubulin deacetylation in mammalian cells. \n We provide evidence that class II histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is the intracellular target of tubacin. \n Tubacin treatment did not affect the stability of microtubules but did decrease cell motility. \n They also suggest that small molecules that selectively inhibit HDAC6-mediated alpha-tubulin deacetylation, a first example of which is tubacin, might have therapeutic applications as antimetastatic and antiangiogenic agents. \n Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC6 promotes chemotactic cell movement, supporting the idea that HDAC6-mediated deacetylation regulates microtubule-dependent cell motility. \n HDAC6 is a major cytoplasmic a-tubulin deacetylase that is involved in cell motility and adhesion. GRK2 dynamically and directly associates with and phosphorylates HDAC6 to stimulate its a-tubulin deacetylase activity at specific cellular localizations, such as the leading edge of migrating cells, thus promoting local tubulin deacetylation and enhanced motility. \n Is tubulin acetylation involved in cell motility?",

        "question": "CONCLUSIONS: Several gene-based urinary biomarkers have demonstrated promise in initial studies, which now need to be rigorously validated in the clinical setting for them to be translated into clinically useful tests in diagnosis, surveillance or risk-stratification of bladder cancer \n  Novel promising markers are in various stages of clinical testing, and a panel of biomarkers may serve in the future as a feasible alternative to urine cytology and cystoscopy for the screening, detection, and follow-up of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. \n RESULTS: Seven of the 8 urine biomarkers were increased in subjects with bladder cancer relative to those without bladder cancer. The 7 biomarkers were assessed in a new model, which had an AUROC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.84-0.93), and 74% sensitivity and 90% specificity. \n The study provides further evidence that the reported panel of diagnostic biomarkers can reliably achieve the noninvasive detection of bladder cancer with higher sensitivity than currently available urine based assays. \n The urinary concentrations of 14 biomarkers (IL-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, SDC1, CCL18, PAI-1, CD44, VEGF, ANG, CA9, A1AT, OPN, PTX3, and APOE) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Diagnostic performance of each biomarker and multivariate models were compared using receiver operating characteristic curves and the chi-square test. An 8-biomarker model achieved the most accurate BCa diagnosis (sensitivity 92%, specificity 97%), but a combination of 3 of the 8 biomarkers (IL-8, VEGF, and APOE) was also highly accurate (sensitivity 90%, specificity 97%). For comparison, the commercial BTA-Trak ELISA test achieved a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 83%, and voided urine cytology detected only 33% of BCa cases in the same cohort. These data show that a multivariate urine-based assay can markedly improve the accuracy of non-invasive BCa detection \n : Histopathological grading of papillary urothelial tumors (PUTs) of the urinary bladder is subjective and poorly reproducible. We investigated the relationship between the expression of frequently deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as their target genes (ZEB1/ZEB2) and bladder cancer histopathological grade in an attempt to find a miRNA that might allow more reliable grading of PUTs. \n The Mcm5 immunoassay is a non-invasive test for identifying patients with urothelial cancers with similar accuracy to the FDA-approved NMP22 ELISA Test Kit. The combination of Mcm5 plus NMP22 improves the detection of UCC and identifies 95% of clinically significant disease. Trials of a commercially developed Mcm5 assay suitable for an end-user laboratory alongside NMP22 are required to assess their potential clinical utility in improving diagnostic and surveillance care pathways. \n HYAL-1 and HAS1 expression predicted BCa metastasis, and HYAL-1 expression also predicted disease-specific survival. Furthermore, the combined HAS2-HYAL-1 biomarker detected BCa and significantly predicted its recurrence. \n Cancer biomarkers are the backbone for the implementation of individualized approaches to bladder cancer (BCa).  \n Through genomic and proteomic profiling of urine, we have identified a panel of biomarkers associated with the presence of BCa. In this study, we evaluated the utility of three of these biomarkers, interleukin 8 (IL-8), Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and Syndecan in the diagnosis of BCa through urinalysis. METHODS: Voided urines from 127 subjects, cancer subjects (n = 64), non-cancer subjects (n = 63) were analyzed. The protein concentrations of IL-8, MMP-9, and Syndecan were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). \n \nWe have demonstrated that urinary levels of IL-8 can be indicative of BCa. The use of IL-8 in conjunction with other validated biomarkers from our global profiling may prove more efficacious than any single biomarker alone. Larger, prospective studies are needed to determine the potential utility of urinary IL-8 as a biomarker in the non-invasive evaluation of patients who are at risk of harboring BCa. \n Cancer of the urinary bladder is among the five most common malignancies worldwide. Urothelial cell carcinomas constitute approximately 95% of all bladder cancer cases, [11] and associated with tobacco exposure [12]. At presentation, more than 80% of bladder tumors are non-muscle invasive papillary tumors (Ta or T1), which harbor a 5-year survival rate of approximately 94%, [13] however, approximately 70% of patients with these lesions develop tumor recurrence within two years of initial diagnosis. The recurrence phenomenon of non-muscle invasive BCa makes it one of the most prevalent cancers world-wide (in America it is second only to colorectal cancer) and is, therefore, a great burden to healthcare systems [13]. Once BCa is detected and treated, patients will routinely get frequent surveillance cystoscopy to monitor for tumor recurrence  \n we have demonstrated that immunofluorometric detection of Mcm5 in urine sediments is a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for bladder cancer. The test detects bladder cancers of all stages and grades. Through evaluation of different assay cut-points there could be a role for predicting high grade and stage disease. Importantly, urinary Mcm5 in combination with the urinary NMP22 measured with the FDA-approved Matritech NMP22\u00ae Test Kit, identifies nearly all life threatening disease. \n The non-invasive detection and monitoring of bladder cancer (BCa) remains a challenge. Voided urinary cytology (VUC) remains the most established urine-based assay for this purpose, but while VUC has a specificity of >93%, the assay suffers from low sensitivity (25\u201340%) and observer-dependent variability \n Cancer of the urinary bladder is among the five most common malignancies worldwide. At presentation, more than 80% of bladder tumors are non-muscle invasive papillary tumors which have a 5-year survival rate of >90%, however, approximately 70% of patients with these lesions develop tumor recurrence within two years of initial diagnosis. The recurrence phenomenon of non-muscle invasive BCa makes it one of the most prevalent cancers world-wide. Once BCa is detected and treated, patients will routinely get frequent surveillance cystoscopy to monitor for tumor recurrence. If left untreated, initially non-invasive tumors can progress to muscle-invasive tumors which have a significantly reduced 5-year survival rate. Thus, accurate detection of BCa, ideally through non-invasive urine-based analysis, remains an urgent goal.\n \n  The ultimate goal is to be able to detect BCa in a timely manner such that the patient can expect an improved quality of life and overall outcome.\nConclusionsThrough discovery phase studies that applied advanced profiling techniques to the actual, preferred clinical test analyte, in this case, voided urine, we have identified molecular signatures that can detect BCa with exceptional accuracy. Validation of combinations of these urinary biomarkers using immunochemical assays confirms that multi-analyte tests could significantly improve the non-invasive detection of BCa, and provide a rationale for larger, prospective studies to be undertaken \n We have presented evidence that the high prevalence of proteinuria in hematuric patients introduces a caveat with respect to using protein as the standardiser of urinary biomarker levels.  \n herefore, it makes more sense to use uncorrected biomarker levels for biomarker studies in hematuric patients.\nOur study provides evidence that urinary diagnostic biomarkers should be standardized by urine volume in hematuric patients where there is a high incidence of proteinuria. Since proteinuria is a common condition in patients with hypertension, ureteric calculi, minimal change glomerulo-nephritis, diabetes, malaria and congestive heart failure, our findings may have implications for a wide range of biomarker discovery, biomarker validation and quantitative proteomic studies investigating complex diseases \n . There was an association between differences in individual biomarkers and differences in protein levels over time, particularly in control patients. Collectively, our findings identify caveats intrinsic to the common practice of protein standardization in biomarker discovery studies conducted on urine, particularly in patients with hematuria \n Are there any urine biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis?",

Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals.  \n In conclusion, patients with CASQ2-associated CPVT should be recommended to receive ICDs to prevent sudden death when medical therapy is not effective. \n  Cardiac channelopathies associated with structurally normal hearts such as long QT syndrome (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS) yield no evidence to be found at autopsy, leaving coroners, medical examiners, and forensic pathologists only to speculate that a lethal arrhythmia might lie at the heart of a sudden unexplained death (SUD). \n Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare adrenergically mediated arrhythmogenic disorder classically induced by exercise or emotional stress and found in structurally normal hearts. It is an important cause of cardiac syncope and sudden death in childhood. \n We also compare CPVT to other notable cardiomyopathic and channelopathic causes of sudden death in youth including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, and Brugada syndrome. \n Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease that can cause sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). \n Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an arrhythmogenic disease that manifests as syncope or sudden death during high adrenergic tone in the absence of structural heart defects. \n Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a cardiac channelopathy characterized by altered intracellular calcium handling resulting in ventricular arrhythmias and high risk of cardiac sudden death in young cases with normal structural hearts \n Early detection of CPVT is crucial because opportune medical intervention prevents sudden cardiac death.  \n  If untreated, CPVT is highly lethal, as approximately 30% of affected individuals experience at least one cardiac arrest and up to 80% one or more syncopal spells. Sudden death may be the first manifestation of the disease.  \n Hereditary non-structural diseases such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), long QT, and the Brugada syndrome as well as structural disease such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) cause a significant percentage of sudden cardiac deaths in the young \n Patients with CPVT present with exercise-induced syncope and sudden cardiac death but normal resting electrocardiograms. \n Although structural cardiovascular abnormalities explain most cases of sudden cardiac death in young people, the cause of death remains unexplained after autopsy in 10% to 30% of cases. Potentially lethal ion channel disorders (channelopathies) such as the long QT syndromes (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and the Brugada syndrome (BrS) may account for at least one-third of these unexplained cases.  \n Based on these data, we propose that CPVT is a combined neurocardiac disorder in which leaky RyR2 channels in the brain cause epilepsy, and the same leaky channels in the heart cause exercise-induced sudden cardiac death. \n The inherited arrhythmogenic diseases associated with the transmembranous ionic channels, anchoring proteins or intracellular calcium regulating proteins are thought to be responsible for sudden cardiac death in infants, children, and young adults who have structurally normal hearts. Recent genetic analyses have identified congenital diseases such as the long-QT syndrome (LQTS), the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), the Brugada syndrome (BrS), the short-QT syndrome (SQTS), the arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 2 (ARVC2), and the catecholamine-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) /familial polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (FPVT).  \n At least some cases of sudden, unexplained death in young individuals may be ascribed to CPVT \n Could Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) cause sudden cardiac death?",

        "question": "he study demonstrated the feasibility of automated FISH signal analysis that applying a CAD scheme to the automated generated 2-D projection images. \n A color imaging technique, multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization (M-FISH), has been developed to ease the analysis of the process. Using an M-FISH technique each chromosome class (1,2, \u2026,22,X,Y) is stained with a unique color. However, significant variations between images are observed due to a number of factors such as uneven hybridization and spectral overlap among channels. These types of variations influence the pixel classification accuracy of image classification methods which are supervised and require a set of annotated images for training. In this paper, we present a fully unsupervised M-FISH chromosome image classification methodology. Our main contributions are 1) the assumption that the intensity of a chromosome pixel is sampled from multiple Gaussian components [Gaussian mixture model (GMM)] such that each component corresponds to one chromosome class, and 2) the initialization of the GMM model using the emission information of each chromosome class. This is feasible since prior to the M-FISH image acquirement, we already know which chromosome class is emitting to each of the five M-FISH image channels. The method has been tested on a large number of M-FISH images and an overall accuracy of 89.85% is reported. Our method is unsupervised and presents higher classification accuracy even when it is compared with common supervised based methods. \n hybridization (FISH) tests provide promising molecular imaging biomarkers to more accurately and reliably detect and diagnose cancers and genetic disorders. Since current manual FISH signal analysis is low-efficient and inconsistent, which limits its clinical utility, developing automated FISH image scanning systems and computer-aided detection (CAD) schemes has been attracting research interests. To acquire high-resolution FISH images in a multi-spectral scanning mode, a huge amount of image data with the stack of the multiple three-dimensional (3-D) image slices is generated from a single specimen. Automated preprocessing these scanned images to eliminate the non-useful and redundant data is important to make the automated FISH tests acceptable in clinical applications. In this study, a dual-detector fluorescence image scanning system was applied to scan four specimen slides with FISH-probed chromosome X. A CAD scheme was developed to detect analyzable interphase cells and map the multiple imaging slices recorded FISH-probed signals into the 2-D projection images. CAD scheme was then applied to each projection image to detect analyzable interphase cells using an adaptive multiple-threshold algorithm, identify FISH-probed signals using a top-hat transform, and compute the ratios between the normal and abnormal cells. To assess CAD performance, the FISH-probed signals were also independently visually detected by an observer. The Kappa coefficients for agreement between CAD and observer ranged from 0.69 to 1.0 in detecting/counting FISH signal spots in four testing samples. \n  In this paper we developed a sparse representation-based classification (SRC) algorithm based on L1-norm minimization for classifying chromosomes from multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) images. The algorithm has been tested on a comprehensive M-FISH database that we established, demonstrating improved performance in classification. When compared with other pixel-wise M-FISH image classifiers such as fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms and adaptive fuzzy c-means (AFCM) clustering algorithms that we proposed earlier the current method gave the lowest classification error. In order to evaluate the performance of different SRC for M-FISH imaging analysis, three different sparse representation methods, namely, Homotopy method, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), and Least Angle Regression (LARS), were tested and compared. Results from our statistical analysis have shown that Homotopy based method is significantly better than the other two methods.  \n Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to study the organization and the positioning of specific DNA sequences within the cell nucleus. Analyzing the data from FISH images is a tedious process that invokes an element of subjectivity. Automated FISH image analysis offers savings in time as well as gaining the benefit of objective data analysis. While several FISH image analysis software tools have been developed, they often use a threshold-based segmentation algorithm for nucleus segmentation. As fluorescence signal intensities can vary significantly from experiment to experiment, from cell to cell, and within a cell, threshold-based segmentation is inflexible and often insufficient for automatic image analysis, leading to additional manual segmentation and potential subjective bias. To overcome these problems, we developed a graphical software tool called FISH Finder to automatically analyze FISH images that vary significantly. By posing the nucleus segmentation as a classification problem, compound Bayesian classifier is employed so that contextual information is utilized, resulting in reliable classification and boundary extraction. This makes it possible to analyze FISH images efficiently and objectively without adjustment of input parameters. Additionally, FISH Finder was designed to analyze the distances between differentially stained FISH probes. \n The simultaneous detection of protein expression and gene copy number changes in patient samples, like paraffin-embedded tissue sections, is challenging since the procedures of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) negatively influence each other which often results in suboptimal staining. Therefore, we developed a novel automated algorithm based on relocation which allows subsequent detection of protein content and gene copy number changes within the same cell. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissue sections of colorectal cancers were stained for CD133 expression. IHC images were acquired and image coordinates recorded. Slides were subsequently hybridized with fluorescently labeled DNA probes. FISH images were taken at the previously recorded positions allowing for direct comparison of protein expression and gene copy number signals within the same cells/tissue areas. Relocation, acquisition of the IHC and FISH images, and enumeration of FISH signals in the immunophenotyped tumour areas were done in an automated fashion. RESULTS: Automated FISH analysis was performed on 13 different colon cancer samples that had been stained for CD133; each sample was scored for MYC, ZNF217 and Chromosome 6 in CD133 positive and negative glands. From the 13 cases four (31%) showed amplification for the MYC oncogene and seven of 13 (54%) cases were amplified for ZNF217. \n The simultaneous detection of protein expression and gene copy number changes in patient samples, like paraffin-embedded tissue sections, is challenging since the procedures of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) negatively influence each other which often results in suboptimal staining.Therefore, we developed a novel automated algorithm based on relocation which allows subsequent detection of protein content and gene copy number changes within the same cell.

        "question": "In the Matrigel invasion assay, knockdown of CCR1 and inhibition of the ERK and Rac signaling pathways significantly decreased the number of invading cells. \n These results demonstrated for the first time that the interaction of CCR1 with CCL5 caused by increased expression of CCR1 promotes invasion of PC3PR cells by increasing secretion of MMPs 2 and 9 and by activating ERK and Rac signaling. \n These data suggest that P-Rex1 has an influence on physiological migratory processes, such as invasion of cancer cells, both through effects upon classical Rac1-driven motility and a novel association with RTK signalling complexes. \n Activated PAR1 induced RhoA and Rac1 phosphorylation, and subsequent overexpression of myosin IIA and filamin B which are stress fiber components that were identified by PMF analysis of peptide mass data obtained by MALDI-TOF/MS measurement.  \n These results demonstrate that PAR1 activation induces cell morphological change associated with cell motility via Rho family activation and cytoskeletal protein overexpression, and has a critical role in gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis. \n Rac1 was found to be required for actopaxin-induced matrix degradation whereas inhibition of myosin contractility promoted degradation in the phosphomutant-expressing Quint cells, indicating that a balance of Rho GTPase signaling and regulation of cellular tension are important for the process. \n Taken together, this study demonstrates a new role for actopaxin phosphorylation in matrix degradation and cell invasion via regulation of Rho GTPase signaling. \n BART inhibits pancreatic cancer cell invasion by Rac1 inactivation through direct binding to active Rac1 \n We report that Binder of Arl Two (BART) plays a role in inhibiting cell invasion by regulating the activity of the Rho small guanosine triphosphatase protein Rac1 in pancreatic cancer cells. \n BART interacts with active forms of Rac1, and the BART-Rac1 complex localizes at the leading edges of migrating cancer cells. Suppression of BART increases active Rac1, thereby increasing cell invasion. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells in which BART is stably knocked down with a Rac1 inhibitor decreases invasiveness. Thus, BART-dependent inhibition of cell invasion is likely associated with decreased active Rac1. \n The Rac1 inhibitor inhibits the lamellipodia formation that is stimulated by suppression of BART. \n Our results imply that BART regulates actin-cytoskeleton rearrangements at membrane ruffles through modulation of the activity of Rac1, which, in turn, inhibits pancreatic cancer cell invasion. \n It has been reported as an important inducer of cancer cell migration and invasion, with underlying molecular mechanisms involving the signalling mediated by its juxtamembrane domain, the secretion of matrix metalloproteases to the extracellular media, and the cleavage of a P-cadherin soluble form with pro-invasive activity. Intracellularly, this protein interferes with the endogenous cadherin/catenin complex, inducing p120-catenin delocalization to the cytoplasm, and the consequent activation of Rac1/Cdc42 and associated alterations in the actin cytoskeleton. \n Targeted down-regulation of RhoC led to sustained activation of Rac1 GTPase and morphological, molecular and phenotypic changes reminiscent of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. \n We also find that Rac1 GTPase mediates tight binding of prostate cancer cells to bone marrow endothelial cells and promotes retraction of endothelial cells required for tumor cell diapedesis. \n Finally, Rac1 leads to \u03b21 integrin activation, suggesting a mechanism that Rac1 can mediate tight binding with endothelial cells. \n Together, our data suggest that Rac1 GTPase is key mediator of prostate cancer cell-bone marrow endothelial cell interactions. \n ctivation of Rac1-PI3K/Akt is required for epidermal growth factor-induced PAK1 activation and cell migration in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells \n Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative Rac1 (T17N) could largely block EGF-induced PI3K/Akt-PAK1 activation and cell migration. \n Our study demonstrated that EGF-induced cell migration involves a cascade of signalling events, including activation of Rac1, generation of ROS and subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt and PAK1. \n Small GTPase proteins, including RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1, and cdc42, are important molecules for linking cell shape and cell-cycle progression because of their role in both cytoskeletal arrangements and mitogenic signaling. \n The suppression of MMP-2 expression by CTXG led to an inhibition of SW620 cells invasion and migration by inactivating Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA GTPase. \n In conclusion, our data demonstrate that CTXG exerted anti-invasion action in SW620 cells by targeting MMP-2 though regulating the activities of Rac1, Cdc42 and their downstream transcriptional factor AP-1. \n ctivation of H-Ras and Rac1 correlates with epidermal growth factor-induced invasion in Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells \n We have previously shown that H-Ras, but not N-Ras, induces an invasive phenotype mediated by small GTPase Rac1 in MCF10A human breast epithelial cells. \n Moreover, siRNA-knockdown of Rac1 significantly inhibited the EGF-induced invasiveness in these cells. \n Our data demonstrate that the activation of H-Ras and the downstream molecule Rac1 correlates with EGF-induced breast cancer cell invasion, providing important information on the regulation of malignant progression in mammary carcinoma cells. \n At 50% growth-inhibiting concentration, icariin significantly suppressed tumor cells migration and invasion, which were traceable to down-regulation of Rac1 and VASP.  \n These results indicate that icariin exerts negative effects on tumor cell invasion and migration via the Rac1-dependent VASP pathway and may be a potential anti-cancer drug. \n RhoGDI2 modulates the invasiveness and metastatic ability of cancer cells through regulation of Rac1 activity. \n We also showed that GBM cells secrete Sema3A endogenously, and RNA interference-mediated downregulation of Sema3A inhibits migration and alters cell morphology that is dependent on Rac1 activity. \n LMO1 and Dock180, a bipartite Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, promote human glioma cell invasion \n Here, we report for the first time that engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1) and dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (Dock180), a bipartite Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), are evidently linked to the invasive phenotype of glioma cells. \n Inhibition of endogenous ELMO1 and Dock180 expression significantly impeded glioma cell invasion in vitro and in brain tissue slices with a concomitant reduction in Rac1 activation. \n ac1 and Rac3 isoform activation is involved in the invasive and metastatic phenotype of human breast cancer cells \n Members of the Rac family of small GTPases are known to act as regulators of actin cytoskeletal structures and strongly influence the cellular processes of integrin-mediated adhesion and migration. Even though hyperactivated Rac proteins have been shown to influence metastatic processes, these proteins have never been directly linked to metastatic progression.  \n We show that increased activation of Rac proteins directly correlates with increasing metastatic potential in a panel of cell variants derived from a single metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-435). \n Expression of a dominant active Rac1 or a dominant active Rac3 resulted in a more invasive and motile phenotype. \n Moreover, expression of either dominant negative Rac1 or dominant negative Rac3 into the most metastatic cell variant resulted in decreased invasive and motile properties. \n This study correlates endogenous Rac activity with high metastatic potential and implicates Rac in the regulation of cell migration and invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. Taken together, these results suggest a role for both the Rac1 and Rac3 GTPases in human breast cancer progression. \n Seminal experiments demonstrated a role for Rac1 in the formation of lamellipodia \n Activation of Rac1 is required to form lamellipodia, which in turn is required for monocytes to sense junctions between endothelial cells \n Rac1 GTPase has a significant effect on PCa cell diapedesis \n we demonstrated that Rac1 GTPase was required for tumor cell transendothelial cell migration \n downregulation of Rac1 led to a significant decrease in diapedesis \n Depletion of Rac1 led to a significant decrease in transendothelial cell migration \n direct depletion of Rac1 or treatment with the inhibitor NSC23766 led to a significant decrease in transendothelial cell migration \n Rac1-mediated diapedesis may be regulated through direct activation of Rac1 or indirectly via RhoG GTPase and the different effects that RhoG has on PCa diapedesisis \n Upon CCL2 stimulation, RhoG appears to play a role in activating Rac1 thereby decreasing diapedesis \n and the activation of Rac1/ROS is critical in regulating cell motility, adhesion and tumor angiogenesis \n our study demonstrated that EGF-induced cell migration involves a cascade of signaling events, including activation of Rac1 \n we demonstrate for the first time a functional linkage between breast cancer cell motility and Rac1-ROS-PI3K/Akt-PAK1 signaling pathway \n this study identifies a novel signaling pathway that accounts for EGF-induced breast cancer cell migration, including activation of Rac1, generation of ROS, subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt and PAK1 \n Rac1 was shown to play a critical role in rat mammary tumor cell growth and metastasis in vivo \n these data suggest a direct role for both Rac1 and Rac3 protein activation in the metastatic progression of human breast cancer \n In this study, we also demonstrate the efficacy of both the Rac1 and Rac3 isoforms in the malignant progression of human breast cancer \n we found that augmenting endogenous Rac activity by expressing dominant active Rac1 or Rac3 led to a significant increase in adhesion, migration, and invasion \n Because we found that expression of dominant active Rac1 or Rac3 results in a similar motile phenotype, it is possible that Rac3 is more efficient at activating proteins that degrade extracellular matrix proteins, or matrix metalloproteinases, than is Rac1 \n these data substantiate not only a vital role for Rac1 in cell functions relevant for breast cancer metastasis, but also a vital role for Rac3. In fact, expression of a dominant active Rac3 in the MDA-MB-435Br1 low metastatic cell variant increased invasion through basal lamina 1.5 times compared to expression of dominant active Rac1. This difference suggests an enhanced ability of the cells expressing Rac3(G12V) to invade, perhaps by a more efficient degradation of the extracellular matrix compared to the cells expressing Rac1(G12V) \n Is Rac1 involved in cancer cell invasion?",

NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B appear to interact structurally and functionally. In this study, we investigated the interaction between the helicase, NS3, and the RNA polymerase, NS5B. Pull-down experiments and surface plasmon resonance data indicate a direct interaction between NS3 and NS5B that is primarily mediated through the protease domain of NS3. This interaction reduces the basal ATPase activity of NS3. However, NS5B stimulates product formation in RNA unwinding experiments under conditions of excess nucleic acid substrate. When the concentrations of NS3 and NS5B are in excess of nucleic acid substrate, NS5B reduces the rate of NS3-catalyzed unwinding. Under pre-steady-state conditions, in which NS3 and substrate concentrations are similar, product formation increased in the presence of NS5B. The increase was consistent with 1:1 complex formed between the two proteins. A fluorescently labeled form of NS3 was used to investigate this interaction through fluorescence polarization binding assays. Results from this assay support interactions that include a 1:1 complex formed between NS3 and NS5B. \n Contradictory results have been reported regarding NS3 in RNA synthesis. To investigate the effect of NS3 on classical swine fever virus (CSFV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (RdRp) activity and NS3-NS5B interaction, RdRp reactions, GST-pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation analyses containing NS5B and either of NS3 protein and the different truncated NS3 mutants were performed, respectively. We found that NS3 stimulated NS5B RdRp activity in a dose-dependent manner by binding to NS5 through a NS3 protease domain. Furthermore, mapping important regions of the NS3 protease domain was carried out by deletion mutagenesis, associated with RdRp reactions, GST-pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Results showed that stimulation of CSFV NS5B RdRp activity was obtained by NS3 binding to NS5B through a 31-amino acid fragment at the N-terminal end of NS3 protease domain, which mediated a specific NS3-NS5B interaction. \n The protocols detailed in this unit are used to purify three recombinant enzymes that are widely used in HCV research: the HCV NS3 protease domain, the helicase domain as an NS3+NS4A complex, and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The active enzymes are purified to homogeneity by two-column chromatography to support a screening program for HCV inhibitors. \n Among potential targets are viral entry factors, including scavenger receptor type B1 (SR-B1) and CD81, as well as neutralizing antibodies against the viral glycoproteins. Popular targets related to translation and replication are the NS3/4A protease (inhibited by telaprevir and boceprevir) and the NS5B polymerase, as well as the NS2/3 autoprotease, the NS3 helicase, and nonenzymatic targets such as NS4B and NS5A proteins.  \n The NS3 helicase domain competes with NS3 full-length for NS5 RdRp binding, with a K(d.) of 2.5\u03bcM. Since NS3 and NS5 are required for DENV replication, this fascile assay could be used to screen for non-nucleoside, allosteric inhibitors that disrupt the interaction between the two proteins. \n Is there any functional association during viral replication between flaviviridae viral RNA depended RNA polymerase and viral helicase?",

Since the discovery, already >15 years ago, of its catalytic component, presenilin, and even much earlier with the identification of amyloid precursor protein as its first substrate, \u03b3-secretase has been commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, starting with Notch and thereafter a continuously increasing number of novel substrates, \u03b3-secretase is becoming linked to an equally broader range of biological processes. \n In the last decade, increasing evidence has pointed out an important role of this pathway beyond embryonic development, indicating that Notch also displays a critical function in the mature brain of vertebrates and invertebrates. This pathway appears to be involved in neural progenitor regulation, neuronal connectivity, synaptic plasticity and learning/memory. In addition, Notch appears to be aberrantly regulated in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and ischemic injury \n Along with \u03b2-secretase, this enzyme produces the amyloid \u03b2-protein of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from the amyloid \u03b2-protein precursor. Because of its key role in the pathogenesis of AD, \u03b3-secretase has been a prime target for drug discovery, and many inhibitors of this protease have been developed. The therapeutic potential of these inhibitors is virtually negated by the fact that \u03b3-secretase is an essential part of the Notch signaling pathway, rendering the compounds unacceptably toxic upon chronic exposure \n High physiological concentrations of A\u03b2 monomer induced angiogenesis by a conserved mechanism that blocks \u03b3-secretase processing of a Notch intermediate, NEXT, and reduces the expression of downstream Notch target genes. Our findings allude to an integration of signaling pathways that utilize \u03b3-secretase activity, which may have significant implications for our understanding of Alzheimer's pathogenesis vis-\u00e0-vis vascular changes that set the stage for ensuing neurodegeneration. \n Aggregated forms of A\u03b2 have a pathogenic role in Alzheimer disease and, thus, reducing the A\u03b2 levels by inhibiting \u03b3-secretase is a possible treatment strategy for Alzheimer disease. Regrettably, clinical trials have shown that inhibition of \u03b3-secretase results in Notch-related side effects. Therefore, it is of great importance to find ways to inhibit amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing without disturbing vital signaling pathways such as Notch.

        "question": "he Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and is a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates normal development in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Dysregulation of Notch signaling has been suggested to be key events in a variety of hematological malignancies. Notch1 signaling appears to be the central oncogenic trigger in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in which the majority of human malignancies have acquired mutations that lead to constitutive activation of Notch1 signaling. \n In a forward genetic screen for mutations that alter intracellular Notch receptor trafficking in Drosophila melanogaster, we recovered mutants that disrupt genes encoding serine palmitoyltransferase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. \n Signaling pathways have become a major source of targets for novel therapies in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Survival benefits achieved with sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, are unprecedented and underscore the importance of improving our understanding of how signaling networks interact in transformed cells. \n Notch-1 immunoexpression is increased in Alzheimer's and Pick's disease \n (PSEN1) is the major locus for mutations causing familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and is also mutated in Pick disease of brain, familial acne inversa and dilated cardiomyopathy. It is a critical facilitator of Notch signalling and many other signalling pathways and protein cleavage events including production of the Amyloid\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide from the AMYLOID BETA A4 PRECURSOR PROTEIN (APP \n PrPSc accumulation in neuronal plasma membranes links Notch-1 activation to dendritic degeneration in prion diseases \n As beta-APP and Notch are both processed by gamma-secretase, we analyzed expression of the Notch signaling pathway in the adult DS brain and in a model system for DS, human trisomy 21 fibroblasts by quantitative PCR. In adult DS cortex we found that Notch1, Dll1 and Hes1 expression is up-regulated. Moreover, DS fibroblasts and Alzheimer disease cortex also show overexpression of Notch1 and Dll1, indicating that enhanced beta-APP processing found in both DS and AD could be instrumental in these changes \n A systems biology approach to Down syndrome: identification of Notch/Wnt dysregulation in a model of stem cells aging \n Notch3 gene has been recently identified as a causative gene for cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) \n we review the evidence that PrPSc accumulates in high concentration in membrane rafts, activates Notch-1 signaling and, in doing so, promotes neuronal dendritic degeneration. \n Activation of Notch-1 stimulates the HES and HERP families of inhibitor effecter proteins [38], which in turn inhibit pro-neuronal genes that maintain the length and branching of dendrites. \n Are there studies representing the involvement of Notch mutations in neurodegenerative diseases such as Down syndrome, Pick's and Prion's disease, and cadasil syndrome?",

        "question": "Turcot syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder clinically characterized by the occurrence of primary tumors of the central nervous system and adenomatous colonic polyps during the first or second decades of life, with a spectrum of clinical features such as \"caf\u00e9-au-lait\" spots, axillary freckling, and hyperpigmented spots.  \n We present the case of a 20-year-old male with a clinical presentation of both glioblastoma multiforme and multiple adenomatous colonic polyps.  \n Turcot syndrome: a synchronous clinical presentation of glioblastoma multiforme and adenocarcinoma of the colon. \n Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare hereditary disorder clinically characterized by the occurrence of primary tumors of the colon and the central nervous system (CNS). Here we present the case of an 11-year-old boy with a synchronous clinical presentation of both glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and colonic adenocarcinoma. \n Based on this case study, the synchronous presentation of glioblastoma multiforme and adenocarcinoma of the colon might suggest a shorter survival rate for patients with Turcot syndrome.  \n A 15-year-old boy was admitted with the diagnosis of colonic polyposis, and during a 2-year follow-up, he underwent operation for right parieto-occipital anaplastic astrocytoma, left-side colonic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and cerebella glioblastoma which were all confirmed by histology. Although cases of Turcot's syndrome (TS) (colonic polyposis and primary brain tumour occurring in the same patient) have been previously described, association with haematological malignancy is rare. We hereby report such a case with TS. \n Type A microsatellite instability in pediatric gliomas as an indicator of Turcot syndrome. \n  Biallelic mutations of MMR genes are associated with pediatric cancers, including glial tumors, in Turcot syndrome type 1 (TS1). \n Glioblastomas with giant cell and sarcomatous features in patients with Turcot syndrome type 1: a clinicopathological study of 3 cases. \n Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare genetic disorder of DNA mismatch repair predisposing to glioblastoma (GBM) in the type 1 variant.  \n We report the clinicopathological and genetic features of 3 gliomas in TS type 1 patients. \n We conclude that 1) the giant cell variant of GBM is overrepresented in TS; 2) gliosarcomas may also be encountered; and 3) survival is often favorable, despite histological anaplasia and exuberant proliferation. \n Malignant transformation of high-grade astrocytoma associated with neurocysticercosis in a patient with Turcot syndrome. \n A 45-year-old woman with anaplastic astrocytoma was clinically diagnosed with Turcot syndrome, and subsequently developed simultaneous neurocysticercosis and malignant transformation to glioblastoma.  \n Familial glioblastoma multiforme is a rather uncommon entity, being in most cases associated to known genetic disorders (as Turcot syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, neurofibromatosis, etc.).  \n Turcot syndrome (MIM276300) has been described as the association of central nervous system malignant tumors and familial colorectal cancer and has been reported to be both a dominant and recessive disorder. \n We report here the first identification of a homozygous mutation in MSH6 in a family with childhood-onset brain tumor, lymphoma, colorectal cancer, and neurofibromatosis type 1 phenotype.  \n Of the 21 patients, 12 have died (10 after relapse, with a median time to progression for the whole series of 14 months; one with intratumoral bleeding at 40 months after diagnosis; and one affected by Turcot syndrome for duodenal cancer relapse). \n [Glioblastoma multiforme as a manifestation of Turcot syndrome]. \n In the present case, a 60-year-old patient with glioblastoma multiforme and a history of hereditary malignomas is described as an example of a HNPCC-associated Turcot's syndrome. \n Computed tomography brain scan and computed tomography-guided biopsy revealed a left frontoparietal glioblastoma multiforme. This case illustrates the rare presentation of Turcot syndrome-a hereditary colorectal polyposis syndrome-in an older adult. \n Turcot syndrome is the association of colorectal polyposis with primary neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system such as glioblastoma and medulloblastoma.  \n Brain tumor is mainly diagnosed as glioblastoma or astrocytoma and mismatch repair genes might be involved.  \n Patients with Turcot syndrome (TS) are predisposed to colon tumors and primary brain tumors, typically glioblastomas or medulloblastomas. The authors describe a patient with TS featuring a known germline mutation of exon 5 of the hPMS2 mismatch repair gene who developed two metachronous glioblastomas, both with distinct oligodendroglial features. \n Because this patient had an unusual underlying condition and his tumor had a unique histological appearance for TS, it was hypothesized that this genetic defect may predispose to malignant gliomas with oligodendroglial features.  \n Turcot Syndrome caused by APC gene develops medulloblastoma and Turcot Syndrome caused by mismatch repair gene develops glioblastoma.  \n It is characterized by central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms and gastrointestinal polyposis. \n Seven months after resection of this Dukes' C2 adenocarcinoma, she presented with a second primary CNS tumor, a glioblastoma multiforme. \n The Turcot syndrome has been defined as the simultaneous presence of multiple polyposis of the colon and a malignant brain tumor. \n The case of a 47-year-old man submitted to a right hemicolectomy for cancer and polyposis, following a series of endoscopic polypectomies and, finally, removal of left temporal glioma is here presented. \n  Two of 13 showed microsatellite instability, one of which in a patient with Turcot syndrome, the other in gliomatosis cerebri. \n The Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare, probably autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by development of primary neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and numerous adenomatous colorectal polyps.  \n However, no somatic mutations in APC were found among 91 neuroepithelial tumors (medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, astrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma), whether sporadic or associated with TS.  \n Such syndromes include neurofibromatosis type 2, neurofibromatosis type 1, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, as well as von Hippel-Lindau disease, tuberous sclerosis, and Turcot syndrome.  \n This patient's case deals with the association between a glioblastoma, anaplastic glioma (WHO Grade III) and colonic adenocarcinoma based on familial polyposis coli.  \n The authors describe two patients with the association of polyposis-coli and central nervous system tumor (Turcot's syndrome).  \n We report a case of Turcot's syndrome in a 20-year old man with multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon and glioblastoma multiforme.  \n Another unusual autopsy case of the Turcot syndrome is reported in a 23-year-old woman with polyposis coli, who developed primary carcinoma of the jejunum and glioblastoma multiforme of the left frontal lobe.  \n Turcot syndrome represents the unique and discrete occurrence of polyposis coli with glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, or both. \n Turcot syndrome (TS) was originally described by Turcot in 1959 [1\u20133]. It is characterized by the development of primary tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and medulloblastoma, along with numerous adenomatous colorectal polyps and colonic adenocarcinoma.  \n In this paper, we present a case of TS with simultaneous clinical presentation of GBM and colonic adenocarcinoma. \n He was diagnosed with Turcot syndrome with cerebral GBM and adenocarcinoma of the colon.  \n From a genetic standpoint, TS can be divided into two subtypes: the first is manifested by the MMR gene and PMS2 with a high risk of developing GBM, and the second type is manifested by the adenomatous polyposis coli gene germline mutation with a high risk of developing medulloblastoma [5, 16]. \n There are reports of cases with the occurrence of both GBM and medulloblastoma, as in the report from McLaughlin and colleagues [12].  \n The pathological differentiation between sporadic GBM and TS-associated GBM has not been adequately addressed in the literature. Recently, Lusis and colleagues reported on three cases involving patients with TS-associated GBM [11].  \n GBM and anaplastic astrocytoma are the most commonly reported CNS tumor associated with TS.  \n Simultaneous clinical presentation of CNS GBM and adenocarcinoma of the colon in TS might be an indicator of a shorter survival rate. Moreover, the presence of GBM may also negatively affect the survival rate in contrast to other types of TS-associated CNS tumors. \n Central nervous system brain tumors occur in both types; type 1 consists of astrocytoma or glioblastoma, and type 2 consists of medulloblastoma [8].  \n Is Turcot syndrome associated with glioblastoma?",

        "question": "Vortioxetine is an orally administered small molecule developed by Lundbeck A/S for the once-daily treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Vortioxetine received its first global approval for MDD in the USA in September 2013 and regulatory approval for its use in this indication in the EU (where it has received a positive opinion) and Canada is awaited.  \n This article summarizes the milestones in the development of vortioxetine leading to this first approval for MDD. \n Vortioxetine was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder. \n On the primary efficacy endpoint, both vortioxetine doses were statistically significantly superior to placebo, with a mean difference to placebo (n=158) of -5.5 (vortioxetine 15 mg, P<0.0001, n=149) and -7.1 MADRS points (vortioxetine 20 mg, P<0.0001, n=151). \n The change in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms was maintained throughout the study as reflected by a 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale total score of 8.2 at week 52 (from 17.6 at open-label baseline) in the observed case data set. \n Vortioxetine is a multi-modal antidepressant that functions as a human 5-HT3A and 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and inhibitor of the serotonin transporter.  \n Approval for the treatment of MDD was based on a clinical development programme that included six positive 6-8 week studies, including one study in elderly people, and one positive maintenance study in adults. \n Vortioxetine represents another option for the treatment of MDD.  \n The multimodal compounds vortioxetine and vilazodone are examples of this approach with diverse mechanisms, and their different clinical effects will provide valuable insights into serotonergic modulation of glutamate transmission for the potential treatment of depression and associated cognitive dysfunction. \n Two new antidepressant drugs, vilazodone (marketed in the USA) and vortioxetine (in development) incorporate partial 5-HT1A-R agonist properties with SERT blockade. \n Novel drugs in development include those that combine multiple simultaneous pharmacologic mechanisms in addition to SERT inhibition within the same molecule, such as vilazodone (combining 5HT1A partial agonism with SERT inhibition), triple reuptake inhibitors (combining norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibition with SERT inhibition), and vortioxetine, a multimodal antidepressant combining actions at the G protein receptor mode (5HT1A and 5HT1B partial agonism and 5HT7 antagonism), at the ion channel mode (5HT3 antagonism) as well as the neurotransmitter transporter mode (SERT inhibition).  \n In this study of adults with MDD treated for 8 weeks with vortioxetine 2.5\u2009mg or 5\u2009mg per day, reductions in depression symptoms were not statistically significant compared with placebo.  \n However, on the basis of these findings, vortioxetine (2.5, 5, 10\u2009mg/day) demonstrated a favourable safety and tolerability profile and maintained effectiveness over 12 months of treatment.  \n In this study of adults with MDD, 5 mg vortioxetine did not differ significantly from placebo in reducing depression symptoms after 6 wk of treatment. \n After 8 weeks of treatment with Lu AA21004 10 mg, there was a significant reduction in HDRS-24 total score compared with placebo in adults with MDD. \n In conclusion, Lu AA21004 was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of elderly patients with recurrent major depressive disorder. \n Thus, Lu AA21004 was effective in preventing relapse of MDD and was well tolerated as maintenance treatment. \n  Findings on secondary outcome measures, using MMRM instead of LOCF, were supportive of likely efficacy for Lu AA21004 5mg and 10mg and duloxetine.  \n In this study, treatment with 5 mg and 10 mg Lu AA21004 for 6 wk was efficacious and well tolerated in patients with MDD. \n Results from phase II clinical trials have reported improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment.  \n In conclusion, treatment with 5 mg and 10 mg Lu AA21004 for 6 wk in this proof-of-concept study was well tolerated and efficacious in reducing depressive and anxious symptoms in patients with MDD. \n There are currently two multimodal compounds with clinically documented antidepressant activity: vilazodone, which is approved for clinical use in the U.S., and vortioxetine, which is undergoing regulatory review. \n Multiple reports of preclinical studies have shown the antidepressant-like activities of vortioxetine.\n112\n\n,\n\n134\n\n\u2013\n\n138\n Further, in clinical studies, its efficacy as an antidepressant has been demonstrated in several studies to date,\n139\n\n\u2013\n\n145\n although statistically significant separation from placebo has not been observed in every clinical trial.\n146\n\n,\n\n147\n \n The antidepressant efficacy of vortioxetine has been demonstrated or supported in doses up to 10 mg/day in placebo-controlled and active treatment-controlled short-term studies of 6\u20138 weeks duration in adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) aged 18\u201375 years (Alvarez et al., 2012; Baldwin et al., 2012; Henigsberg et al., 2012) or at least 65 years (Katona et al., 2012), and in relapse prevention in adults with MDD (Boulenger et al., 2012).\n \n EfficacyPrimary efficacy endpointIn the primary efficacy analysis, both doses of vortioxetine were statistically significantly superior to placebo in mean change from baseline in MADRS total score at week 8 (FAS, MMRM), with a mean treatment difference to placebo of \u22125.5 (vortioxetine 15 mg, SE=1.1, P<0.0001) and \u22127.1 points (vortioxetine 20 mg, SE=1.1, P<0.0001).  \n The results of five randomized clinical trials of vortioxetine in the acute treatment of MDD have been published to date; they used doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/day. Apart from one failed and one negative placebo-controlled study, both conducted in the USA using vortioxetine 5 mg/day (Jain et al., 2013; Mahableshwarkar et al., 2013), three studies demonstrated a significant antidepressant activity of daily doses of 5 and 10 mg in adults and the elderly (Alvarez et al., 2012; Henigsberg et al., 2012; Katona et al., 2012) and one failed study was supportive of these doses (Baldwin et al., 2012). \n Thus, vortioxetine has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in both the short-term and long-term treatment of MDD.\n \n In the present study vortioxetine had a favourable effect on a broad range of depressive symptoms, as demonstrated by a statistically significant decrease in all 10 MADRS single items throughout the 8-week treatment period, suggesting that vortioxetine may offer therapeutic benefit in reducing overall residual symptomatology.\n \n Both vortioxetine doses, as well as duloxetine 60 mg (used as the active reference), demonstrated a statistically significant effect on the primary and all key secondary efficacy criteria in prespecified testing sequence.  \n Is Vortioxetine effective for treatment of depression?",

Whether HIF2alpha expressing tumors are more sensitive to larger radiotherapy fractions, compared to standard radiotherapy fractionation, is an issue that deserves further investigation. \n HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha were expressed in the nuclei and cytoplasm of cancer cells, while CA9 had a membrane reactivity. A high expression of HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and CA9 was noted in 21/39 (53.8%), 20/39 (51.3%) and 23/39 (58.9%) cases, respectively. Complete response was obtained in 85.2% of patients and HIF1alpha was marginally related with persistent disease after RT (p = 0.05). HIF1alpha was significantly associated with poor local relapse free survival (LRFS) (p = 0.006) and overall survival (p = 0.008), whilst HIF2alpha was no \n  The glucose and oxygen levels in the peripheral blood of patients receiving 1000 mg amifostine were determined at various time-points in order to investigate the metabolic changes induced by amifostine. MDA468 breast tumor cell lines were incubated with a high amifostine concentration (10 m M) to overcome the natural resistance of cancer cells to influx of the non-hydrolyzed WR-2721, and the HIF1 alpha protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis \n Since it is doubtful whether dephosphorylation of amifostine to the active metabolite WR-1065 occurs within tumoral tissues (an acidic environment that lacks vascular alkaline phosphatase activity), intracellular hypoxia and upregulation of HIF1 alpha represents an additional, normal tissue-specific, amifostine cytoprotective pathway. \n . Incubation of cell lines with amifostine resulted in HIF1 alpha induction \n irst developed for its cytoprotective properties against radiation, amifostine is now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use as a cytoprotector in several anti-cancer therapies [1]. Amifostine, also called Ethyol\u00ae, is a phosphorylated aminothiol (WR-2721). Its intracellular activity relies on its dephosphorylation by membrane bound alkaline phosphatase [2], thus producing the free thiol WR-1065. WR-1065 acts as a free radical scavenger and is considered to be the effective cytoprotector, affording protection against the toxic side effects of both chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiations  \n Amifostine has also been reported to act as a hypoxia-mimetic compound able to promote hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 accumulation both in vitro and in vivo [13]. HIF-1\u03b1 is a major stress regulator induced by cancer cells in response to ischaemia during tumour development. Stabilized by hypoxia, HIF-1\u03b1 heterodimerizes with the HIF-1\u03b2 subunit and activates the transcription of different sets of genes involved in numerous cellular processes including metabolism, apoptosis and angiogenesis [14]. The most prominent pro-angiogenic factor activated by HIF in response to hypoxia is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A).  \n Does the concentration of protein HIF-1\u03b1 increase after the administration of the cytoprotective prodrug\"amifostine\" (ethyol) ?",

The target of one inhibitor peptide, Pep80, identified in this screen was determined to be Snapin, a protein associated with the soluble N-ethyl maleimide sensitive factor adaptor protein receptor (SNARE) complex that is critical for calcium-dependent exocytosis during neurotransmission.  \n Use of the genetically selected intracellular aptamer inhibitors allowed us to define unique mechanisms important to HIV-1 replication and T cell biology. \n This review will describe pre-clinical and clinical data of four major classes of TGF-\u03b2 inhibitor, namely i) ligand traps, ii) antisense oligonucleotides, iii) receptor kinase inhibitors and iv) peptide aptamers.  \n  A peptide aptamer (ID1/3-PA7) has been designed to prevent this interaction and thereby leading to the transcription of p16(INK4a). \n A peptide kinase inhibitor (IP(20)) was used as the aptameric peptide  \n Peptide aptamer mimicking RAD51-binding domain of BRCA2 inhibits DNA damage repair and survival in Trypanosoma brucei. \n Inhibition of Id proteins by a peptide aptamer induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells. \n  peptide aptamer, Id1/3-PA7, targeting Id1 and Id3, \n Targeting Id1 and Id3 by a specific peptide aptamer induces E-box promoter activity, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in breast cancer cells. \n Aptamer-derived peptides as potent inhibitors of the oncogenic RhoGEF Tgat. \n Our approach thus demonstrates that peptide aptamers are potent inhibitors that can be used to interfere with RhoGEF functions in vivo. \n Development of systemic in vitro evolution and its application to generation of peptide-aptamer-based inhibitors of cathepsin E. \n he fusion peptide, TA aptamer, was observed within PC12 cytoplasm and maintained both Abeta-binding ability and antioxygenic property similar to TRX. \n Stable expression of a novel fusion peptide of thioredoxin-1 and ABAD-inhibiting peptide protects PC12 cells from intracellular amyloid-beta. \n In order to efficiently select aptamers that bind to and inhibit proteins, \n Aptamer selection based on inhibitory activity using an evolution-mimicking algorithm. \n This demonstrates the utility of this strategy for screening aptamers based on their inhibitory actions. \n Intracellular expression of the DRD-binding peptide aptamer specifically suppressed receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis but not intrinsic pathway, which was recapitulated by the antisense oligonucleotides for FLASH.  \n Peptide aptamers are peptides constrained and presented by a scaffold protein that are used to study protein function in cells. They are able to disrupt protein-protein interactions  \n Here we have used a genetic screen in yeast to select in vivo peptides coupled to thioredoxin, called aptamers, that could inhibit GEFD2 activity. One aptamer, TRIAPalpha (TRio Inhibitory APtamer), specifically blocks GEFD2-exchange activity on RhoA in vitro. \n These results show that cell proliferation can be inhibited using genetically-selected synthetic peptides that specifically target protein-protein interaction motifs within cell cycle regulators. \n we used a dominant effector genetic selection scheme to select an aptamer, Pep80, that inhibits HIV-1 replication and T cell activation.  \n targeting intracellular TGF-\u03b2 signaling molecules, such as Smads, is possible with the use of peptide aptamers, although this is the least explored therapeutic strategy.  \n Another possible strategy to block TGF-\u03b2 signaling for cancer is to interfere with the TGF-\u03b2 signaling molecules, the Smads, that act downstream of the type I receptor. This may be achieved by using peptide aptamers.  \n To develop a new strategy for the inhibition of Id1 and Id3, we isolated a novel peptide aptamer Id1/3-PA7 that specifically interacts with Id1 and Id3 (Mern et al, 2010). Peptide aptamers represent short peptides of random sequences.  \n  Peptide aptamer Id1/3-PA7 significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, with deregulated expression of Id1 and Id3.  \n These data highlight the utility of peptide aptamers to identify novel binding interfaces and highlight a role for MAP1B in DAPK-1-dependent signaling in autophagy and membrane blebbing. \n Can a peptide aptamer be used as protein inhibitor?",

Discoveries of mutations and aberrant expression of components in this cascade, in particular, BRAF and NRAS render a deeper understanding of the mechanisms responsible for oncogenesis and provide new therapeutic strategies for this deadly disease.  \n  BRAF-targeted therapies (e.g., vemurafenib, dabrafenib) have showed impressive results in systemic therapy for melanoma harboring activating BRAF V600E mutations.  \n  An independent cohort of 91 archival MUPs was also screened for 46 hot spot mutations highly prevalent in melanoma including BRAF, NRAS, KIT, GNAQ, and GNA11. \n  a high rate of BRAF (45 of 101, 45%) and NRAS (32 of 101, 32%) mutations, collectively indicating a mutation profile consistent with cutaneous sun-exposed melanomas. \n Treatment of advanced melanoma has been improved with the advent of the BRAF inhibitors. \n BRAF is the most prevalent oncogene and an important therapeutic target in melanoma. \n Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers. Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer.  \n BRAF mutations have emerged as an important predictive biomarker for metastasized melanoma.  \n BRAF V600 selective inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of V600 mutation positive metastatic melanoma,  \n BRAF(V600) mutation-positive melanoma  \n Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. The treatment of patients with advanced melanoma is rapidly evolving due to an improved understanding of molecular drivers of this disease. Somatic mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alteration found in these tumors. \n  genetically activated BRAF, is now commonly prescribed for metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF mutation. \n BRAF inhibitors improve melanoma patient survival, but resistance invariably develops.  \n BRAF inhibitors elicit rapid antitumor responses in the majority of patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, but acquired drug resistance is almost universal.  \n Most patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance to selective RAF kinase inhibitors.  \n BRAF(V600E) mutation confers constitutive BRAK kinase activation in melanoma cells, promoting tumor growth. This discovery led to the development of BRAF kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib.  \n (V600)BRAF mutation was identified as an ideal target for clinical therapy due to its indispensable roles in supporting melanoma initiation and progression. \n The Braf(V600E) mutation has been detected in patients with metastatic melanoma, colon, thyroid, and other cancers. \n Since the identification of activating BRAF mutations and subsequent development of drugs targeting the mutant BRAF protein, oncologists now need to incorporate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into treatment decisions for their melanoma patient \n BRAF mutations occur in approximately 8% of all human cancers and approach 50% in melanoma and papillary carcinoma of thyroid. \n Vemurafenib is a selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of the V600 mutant form of the BRAF protein used in the treatment of melanoma and colorectal cancer. \n Molecular studies demonstrated that the melanoma was positive for the 1799T>A (V600E) mutation in the BRAF gene. \n RAF kinase inhibitors have substantial therapeutic effects in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. \n An activating BRAF (V600E) kinase mutation occurs in approximately half of melanomas.  \n Activating mutations in the BRAF gene occur in approximately 50% of melanomas. More than 70% of BRAF mutations are V600E and 10-30% are V600K. \n Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers. \n Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer.  \n Personalized melanoma medicine has progressed from histopathologic features to serum markers to molecular profiles. Since the identification of activating BRAF mutations and subsequent development of drugs targeting the mutant BRAF protein, oncologists now need to incorporate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into treatment decisions for their melanoma patients. \n The clinical activity of BRAF inhibitor (BRAF-I) therapy is a major breakthrough in the treatment of metastatic melanoma carrying BRAF mutations.  \n The discovery of BRAF mutations in melanoma led to the development of BRAF inhibitors for the treatment of advanced melanoma.  \n BRAF represents one of the most frequently mutated protein kinase genes in human tumours. The mutation is commonly tested in pathology practice. BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia. \n Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients.  \n A majority of cutaneous melanomas show activating mutations in the NRAS or BRAF proto-oncogenes, components of the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk (MAPK) signal transduction pathway. The discovery of activating BRAF mutations in \u223c50% of all melanomas has proved to be a turning point in the therapeutic management of the disseminated disease. This review summarizes the critical role of BRAF in melanoma pathophysiology, the clinical and pathological determinants of BRAF mutation status and finally addresses the current state of the art of BRAF inhibitors. \n To better understand the BRAF mutation profile in melanomas, we retrospectively analyzed data from 1112 primary and metastatic melanomas at our institution. The cohort included nonacral cutaneous (n = 774), acral (n = 111), mucosal (n = 26), uveal (n = 23), leptomeningeal (n = 1), and metastatic melanomas of unknown primary site (n = 177). BRAF mutation hotspot regions in exons 11 and 15 were analyzed by pyrosequencing or with the primer extension MassARRAY system. A total of 499 (44.9%) specimens exhibited BRAF mutations, involving exon 15 [497 (99.6%)] or exon 11 [2 (0.4%)]. p.V600E was detected in 376 (75.4%) cases; the remaining 123 (24.6%) cases exhibited non-p.V600E mutations, of which p.V600K was most frequent [86 (17.2%)]. BRAF mutations were more frequent in nonacral cutaneous (51.4%) than acral melanomas [18 (16.2%)] (P < 0.001); however, there was no significant difference among cutaneous histological subtypes. All mucosal, uveal, and leptomeningeal melanomas were BRAF wild type (WT). \n Recently, it was reported that BRAF mutations are frequent in melanoma. \n Activating mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alterations in melanoma. \n Oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations are frequent in malignant melanoma. \n Mutation of BRAF is now known to be common in cutaneous melanomas, and raises possible new therapeutic options of anti-RAF treatment for these patients \n BRAF mutations are common events in a variety of melanocytic nevi and primary cutaneous melanomas \n Approximately 40-60% of melanomas from Caucasian populations carry activating mutations in the BRAF oncogene, with the most common being the p.Val600Glu (V600E) hotspot mutation in exon 15 \n Using a cohort of 115 patients with primary invasive melanomas, we show that BRAF mutations are statistically significantly more common in melanomas occurring on skin subject to intermittent sun exposure than elsewhere (23 of 43 patients; P<.001, two-sided Fisher's exact test) \n BRAF mutations have been identified as the most common oncogene mutation in melanomas, especially important in those originating on nonchronically sun-damaged skin.  \n Are BRAF mutations common in melanoma?",

Transcription of these genes is usually repressed by epigenetic modifications of this chromosomal region and also accumulation of transcriptional repressors to the repeat array. \n Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues.  \n The human double-homeodomain retrogene DUX4 is expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues. \n Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX4, a retrogene encoding a germline transcription factor encoded in each repeat. \n  These mice recapitulate important epigenetic and DUX4 expression attributes seen in patients and controls, respectively, including high DUX4 expression levels in the germline, (incomplete) epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, and FSHD-specific variegated DUX4 expression in sporadic muscle nuclei associated with D4Z4 chromatin relaxation. \n DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally epigenetically silenced in somatic cells. \n In contrast to control skeletal muscle and most other somatic tissues, full-length DUX4 transcript and protein is expressed at relatively abundant levels in human testis, most likely in the germ-line cells. Induced pluripotent (iPS) cells also express full-length DUX4 and differentiation of control iPS cells to embryoid bodies suppresses expression of full-length DUX4, whereas expression of full-length DUX4 persists in differentiated FSHD iPS cells.

It leads to aganglionic megacolon in the early childhood. Several susceptibility genes have been identified : RET protooncogene and its ligand, glial cell derived neutrophic factor (GDNF), Sox 10, Endothelin-3 (EDN3) and its receptor B (EDNRB). EDNRB mutations are found in 5% of familial or sporadic HSCR \n Enteric aganglionosis in Hirschsprung disease has been linked to genes coding for endothelin-3 (EDN3) and the endothelin B receptor (EDNRB) \n To date, three genes have been identified as susceptibility genes for Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), the RET proto-oncogene, the endothelin-B receptor gene (EDNRB) and the endothelin-3 gene (EDN3) \n Our data indicate that RET and EDNRB mutations have a role in the aetiology of some sporadically occurring HSCR \n Mutations of the endothelin-B receptor and endothelin-3 genes in Hirschsprung's disease \n The endothelin-B receptor gene (EDNRB) and the endothelin-3 gene (EDN3) have recently been recognized as susceptibility genes for Hirschsprung's disease (HD) \n These observations confirm that impaired function of the endothelin-B receptor or endothelin-3 is involved in the aetiology of some human HD cases. EDNRB mutations appear to be associated with short-segment HD, in contrast to RET mutations, which are found mainly in long-segment aganglionosis \n In addition to mutations in the RET and EDNRB genes, embryonic environmental factors and/or other genetic factors appear to be involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease. \n Heterozygous endothelin receptor B (EDNRB) mutations in isolated Hirschsprung disease. \n QTL analysis identifies a modifier locus of aganglionosis in the rat model of Hirschsprung disease carrying Ednrb(sl) mutations. \n Homozygous mutations in the endothelin-B receptor gene (EDNRB) on 13q22 have been identified in humans and mice with Hirschsprung disease type 2 (HSCR2). \n A De Novo novel mutation of the EDNRB gene in a Taiwanese boy with Hirschsprung disease. \n Hitherto however, homozygosity for EDNRB mutations accounted for the HSCR-Waardenburg syndrome (WS) association. \n These data might suggest that EDNRB mutations could be dosage sensitive: heterozygosity would predispose to isolated HSCR with incomplete penetrance, while homozygosity would result in more complex neurocristopathies associating HSCR and WS features. \n Highly recurrent RET mutations and novel mutations in genes of the receptor tyrosine kinase and endothelin receptor B pathways in Chinese patients with sporadic Hirschsprung disease. \n Mutations in genes encoding the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) are involved in HSCR pathogenesis; however, also important in ENS development are molecules that mediate events that are more restricted than those of RET and EDNRB, act later in development and which might not be HSCR-associated. \n Several missense mutations of the endothelin-B receptor (EDNRB) associated with Hirschsprung disease have recently been identified. \n These findings indicate that these missense mutations result in loss of function of EDNRB, and may provide the molecular pathological basis of Hirschsprung disease in some individuals. \n Manifestation of the disease has been linked to mutations in genes that encode the crucial signals for the development of the enteric nervous system-the RET and EDNRB signalling pathways. \n In addition to mutations in the RET and EDNRB genes, embryonic environmental factors and/or other genetic factors appear to be involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease \n In this study, we investigated whether germline mutations of endothelin receptor B (EDNRB), a gene involved in Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), could also predispose for malignant melanoma (MM) \n However, the similarity between the distal colonic aganglionosis in Hirschsprung disease and that due to EDN3 or EDNRB mutations led to the hypothesis that levels of expression of these genes might be affected in the absence of mutation, thus causing the Hirschsprung disease phenotype \n Our data strongly suggest that EDNRB is involved in predisposition for two different multigenic disorders, HSCR and melanoma. \n Are EDNRB mutations involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease?",

Twenty-four hours after brain trauma, T3-treated mice also showed significantly lower number of TUNEL(+) apoptotic neurons and curtailed induction of Bax, compared to vehicle control. In addition, T3 significantly enhanced the post-TBI expression of the neuroprotective neurotrophins (BDNF and GDNF) compared to vehicle.  \n The stimulating effect of T3 on peripheral nerve regeneration may have considerable therapeutic potential. \n The present study provides evidence that the peripheral nervous system has its own system responsible for the local production of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, which may play a key role during the regeneration process. \n Although it has been hypothesized that T3 may facilitate neuronal regeneration after CNS injury, the 5'-D2 response to brain injury is unknown. \n The outcome after brain injury is closely correlated with the intensity of these changes, particularly with catecholamine plasma levels and the severity of the low triiodothyronine syndrome. \n The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine appear to enhance regeneration in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS).  \n T3 treatment influenced the general levels of incorporation of all treated groups over all days postoperation. \n T3 effects appear to involve an increased sensitivity of the cells of the injured nervous system to the hormone. \n T3, when administered over an 8 week period, stimulated axonal regeneration in the dorsal cortex and corpus callosum and promoted healing of the wound in the corpus callosum.

        "question": "Notch receptors participate in a highly conserved signalling pathway that regulates normal development and tissue homeostasis in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Deregulated Notch signalling has been implicated in many diseases, but the clearest example of a pathogenic role is found in T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (T-LL), in which the majority of human and murine tumours have acquired mutations that lead to aberrant increases in Notch1 signalling. \n NOTCH proteins (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4) play crucial roles in embryonic development. Also, mounting evidence indicates that NOTCH contributes to the pathogenesis of hematopoietic and solid malignancies. Recent studies reported a high incidence of gain-of-function mutations of the NOTCH1 gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL).  \n Our data indicate that NOTCH1 is mutated in T-ALL, but not in other common human cancers, and that NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTH4 genes are rarely mutated in common human cancers.  \n The Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and is a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates normal development in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Dysregulation of Notch signaling has been suggested to be key events in a variety of hematological malignancies. Notch1 signaling appears to be the central oncogenic trigger in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in which the majority of human malignancies have acquired mutations that lead to constitutive activation of Notch1 signaling. \n T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is characterized as a high-risk stratified disease associated with frequent relapse, chemotherapy resistance, and a poorer prognostic outlook than B-precursor ALL. Many of the challenges in treating T-ALL reflect the lack of prognostic cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities on which to base therapy, including targeted therapy. Notch1 activating mutations were identified in more than 50% of T-ALL cases and can be therapeutically targeted with \u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs).  \n Notch1 is a transmembrane receptor that is frequently mutated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  \n T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) is characterized by aberrant activation of NOTCH1 in over 60% of T-ALL cases. The high prevalence of activating NOTCH1 mutations highlights the critical role of NOTCH signaling in the pathogenesis of this disease and has prompted the development of therapeutic approaches targeting the NOTCH signaling pathway.  \n Activating mutations in NOTCH1, an essential regulator of T cell development, are frequently found in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  \n NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). \n Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients. \n Mutations in NOTCH1/FBXW7 activate NOTCH signaling and are of prognostic significance in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). \n Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). \n Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling. \n Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients. \n Mutations in NOTCH1/FBXW7 activate NOTCH signaling and are of prognostic significance in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). \n Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling. \n Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients. \n Activation of the Notch pathway occurs commonly in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) because of mutations in Notch1 or Fbw7 and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. \n T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients frequently display NOTCH1 activating mutations and Notch can transcriptionally down-regulate the tumor suppressor PTEN. \n The identification of activating mutations in NOTCH1 in over 50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) has generated major interest in the elucidation of the mechanisms of transformation downstream of oncogenic NOTCH and in the targeting of the NOTCH signaling pathway in this disease. \n BACKGROUND: In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL), activating mutations of NOTCH1 are observed in more than 50% of cases, whereas the t(7;9)(q34;q34) involving NOTCH1 at 9q34 and TRB@ at 7q34 is an extremely rare but recurrent translocation. \n Notch receptors participate in a highly conserved signalling pathway that regulates normal development and tissue homeostasis in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Deregulated Notch signalling has been implicated in many diseases, but the clearest example of a pathogenic role is found in T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (T-LL), in which the majority of human and murine tumours have acquired mutations that lead to aberrant increases in Notch1 signalling. \n Activation of the Notch pathway occurs commonly in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) because of mutations in Notch1 or Fbw7 and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. \n Activating mutations in NOTCH1 consitute the most prominent genetic abnormality in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). \n T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive cancer that is frequently associated with activating mutations in NOTCH1 and dysregulation of MYC \n The Notch signaling pathway has been recognized as a key factor for the pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), because of the high incidence of activating mutations of Notch1 \n Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling \n NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) \n Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients \n Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) \n Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling \n NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) \n Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients \n Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) \n NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) \n Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling \n Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients \n Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) \n NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) \n Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling \n Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients \n Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) \n NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) \n Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients \n Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) \n Are Notch mutations related to T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL)?",

        "question": "Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a group of congenital myopathies, characterized by the presence of distinct rod-like inclusions \"nemaline bodies\" in the sarcoplasm of skeletal muscle fibers. To date, ACTA1, NEB, TPM3, TPM2, TNNT1, and CFL2 have been found to cause NM. \n Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes including NEB (nebulin), TPM2 (beta-tropomyosin), TPM3 (gamma-tropomyosin), and ACTA1 (skeletal alpha-actin). 20-25% of NM cases carry ACTA1 defects and these particular mutations usually induce substitutions of single residues in the actin protein.  \n Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a genetically and clinically heterogenous muscle disorder, which is myopathologically characterized by nemaline bodies. Mutations in six genes have been reported to cause NM: Nebulin (NEB Pelin 1999), alpha-skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1 Nowak 1999), alpha-slow tropomyosin (TPM3 Laing 1995), beta-tropomyosin (TPM2 Donner 2002), slow troponin T (TNNT1 Johnston 2000) and cofilin 2 (CFL2 Agrawal 2007). The majority of cases are due to mutation in NEB and ACTA1.  \n Nemaline myopathy is a heterogenous form of congenital myopathy characterised by a variable spectrum of clinical features, predominated in the severe form by profound muscle hypotonia and weakness accompanied by respiratory insufficiency. The clinical variability, with differing age of onset and severity of symptoms makes the diagnosis of nemaline myopathy difficult in some cases. Severe forms of nemaline myopathy may be caused by mutation of a number of different genes: skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1), nebulin (NEB) and alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3), all of which encode components of the sarcomeric thin filaments of skeletal muscle.  \n Most nemaline myopathy patients have mutations in the nebulin (NEB) or skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) genes.  \n We report muscle MRI findings of 10 patients from 8 families with nemaline myopathy. Patients with involvement of the nebulin (NEB) gene showed a consistent pattern of selective muscle involvement corresponding to clinical severity. \n Patients with nemaline myopathy secondary to mutations in the skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) gene showed diffuse involvement of thigh and leg muscles with relative sparing of the gastrocnemii. \n Congenital myopathies are clinical and genetic heterogeneous disorders characterized by skeletal muscle weakness ranging in severity. Three major forms have been identified: actin myopathy, intranuclear rod myopathy, and nemaline myopathy. Nemaline myopathy is the most common of these myopathies and is further subdivided into seven groups according to severity, progressiveness, and age of onset. At present, five genes have been linked to congenital myopathies. These include alpha-actin (ACTA1), alpha- and beta-tropomyosin (TPM3 and TPM2), troponin T (TNNT1), and nebulin (NEB).  \n Nemaline myopathy is a structural congenital myopathy which may show both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns. Mutations in three different genes have been identified as the cause of nemaline myopathy: the gene for slow alpha-tropomyosin 3 (TPM3) at 1q22-23, the nebulin gene (NEB) at 2q21.1-q22, and the actin gene (ACTA1) at 1q42. \n Nemaline myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition. The clinical spectrum ranges from severe cases with antenatal or neonatal onset and early death to late onset cases with only slow progression.

The ring-shaped cohesin complex is loaded onto chromosomes before S phase in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent reaction. Cohesion establishment during DNA replication follows without further cohesin recruitment and without need for cohesin to re-engage an ATP hydrolysis motif that is critical for its initial DNA binding. This provides evidence for cohesion establishment in the context of replication forks and imposes constraints on the mechanism involved \n Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II \n In budding yeast, a specialized replication factor C called RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and the DNA-polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis \n We also show that, in contrast to mitosis, RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Cft8), Ctf4 and Chl1 are essential for chromosome segregation during meiosis and for the viability of meiotic products. \n Ctf8p is a component of Ctf18-RFC, an alternative replication factor C-like complex required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We performed synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis with a ctf8 deletion strain as a primary screen to identify other nonessential genes required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion. We then assessed proficiency of cohesion at three chromosomal loci in strains containing deletions of the genes identified in the ctf8 SGA screen. Deletion of seven genes (CHL1, CSM3, BIM1, KAR3, TOF1, CTF4, and VIK1) resulted in defective sister chromatid cohesion \n Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTF18 and CTF4 are required for sister chromatid cohesion \n CTF4 and CTF18 are required for high-fidelity chromosome segregation. Both exhibit genetic and physical ties to replication fork constituents.

In rice, most of these CpG clusters are associated with genes. Rice genes are grouped into one of the five classes according to the position of an associated CpG cluster. Among them, class 1 genes, which harbor a CpG cluster at the 5'-terminus, share similarities with human genes having CpG islands \n Segmental distribution of genes harboring a CpG island-like region on rice chromosomes \n Highly-expressed Arabidopsis genes had overall a more marked GC-skew in the TSS compared to genes with low expression levels. We therefore propose that the GC-skew around the TSS in some plants and fungi is related to transcription. It might be caused by mutations during transcription initiation or the frequent use of transcription factor-biding sites having a strand preference. In addition, GC-skew is a good candidate index for TSS prediction in plant genomes, where there is a lack of correlation among CpG islands and genes \n Preliminary analysis shows that promoter location based on the detection of potential CpG/CpNpG islands in the Arabidopsis genome is not straightforward.

        "question": "Although most cancer research has focused in mRNA, non-coding RNAs are also an essential player in tumorigenesis. In addition to the well-recognized microRNAs, recent studies have also shown that epigenetic silencing by CpG island hypermethylation of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) or small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), also occur in human neoplasia \n Starting from a genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the modulation of long noncoding transcripts from ultraconserved regions, termed transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). Interestingly, several hypoxia-upregulated T-UCRs, henceforth named 'hypoxia-induced noncoding ultraconserved transcripts' (HINCUTs), are also overexpressed in clinical samples from colon cancer patients \n Consistent with the hypothesis that T-UCRs have important function in tumor formation \n The importance of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) and transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) as altered elements in neoplasia, is also gaining recognition \n Expression levels of transcribed ultraconserved regions uc.73 and uc.388 are altered in colorectal cancer \n Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a subset of 481 sequences longer than 200 bp, which are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of human, rat and mouse genomes, and are actively transcribed. It has recently been proven in cancer systems that differentially expressed T-UCRs could alter the functional characteristics of malignant cells. Genome-wide profiling revealed that T-UCRs have distinct signatures in human leukemia and carcinoma \n  Our preliminary results suggest that uc.73 and uc.388 could be potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in CRC patients \n The transcribed-ultraconserved regions: a novel class of long noncoding RNAs involved in cancer susceptibility \n This review gives a picture of the state of the art of a novel class of long ncRNA known as transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). Most recent studies show that they are significantly altered in adult chronic lymphocytic leukemias, carcinomas, and pediatric neuroblastomas, leading to the hypothesis that UCRs may play a role in tumorigenesis and promising innovative future T-UCR-based therapeutic approaches \n CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of non-coding RNAs transcribed from ultraconserved regions in human cancer \n We focused on the transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), a subset of DNA sequences that are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of the human, rat and mouse genomes and that are located in both intra- and intergenic regions. We used a pharmacological and genomic approach to reveal the possible existence of an aberrant epigenetic silencing pattern of T-UCRs by treating cancer cells with a DNA-demethylating agent followed by hybridization to an expression microarray containing these sequences. We observed that DNA hypomethylation induces release of T-UCR silencing in cancer cells. Among the T-UCRs that were reactivated upon drug treatment, Uc.160+, Uc283+A and Uc.346+ were found to undergo specific CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing in cancer cells compared with normal tissues. The analysis of a large set of primary human tumors (n=283) demonstrated that hypermethylation of the described T-UCR CpG islands was a common event among the various tumor types. Our finding that, in addition to microRNAs, another class of ncRNAs (T-UCRs) undergoes DNA methylation-associated inactivation in transformed cells supports a model in which epigenetic and genetic alterations in coding and non-coding sequences cooperate in human tumorigenesis \n An integrative genomics screen uncovers ncRNA T-UCR functions in neuroblastoma tumours \n Different classes of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, have recently been implicated in the process of tumourigenesis. In this study, we examined the expression and putative functions of a novel class of non-coding RNAs known as transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) in neuroblastoma \n our results define a T-UCR expression landscape in neuroblastoma and suggest widespread T-UCR involvement in diverse cellular processes that are deregulated in the process of tumourigenesis \n Moreover, the recent demonstration that other ncRNAs, the ultraconserved genes (UCGs) or transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), are involved in human cancerogenesis, suggests that the wider family of ncRNAs (including both miRNAs and UCGs) could contribute to the development of the malignant phenotype.

        "question": "The use of HIPEC after aggressive cytoreductive surgery in patients with ovarian cancer with peritoneal dissemination can be performed with acceptable postoperative morbidity rates. Knowledge of the factors associated with the onset of these postoperative adverse events allows better management of the same and offers the patient a safe procedure \n These results showed that the association of HIPEC with a complete cytoreduction for recurrent ovarian cancer presents acceptable morbidity and survival \n There is level-one evidence suggesting the benefit of postoperative adjuvant intraperitoneal chemotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer after cytoreductive surgery, albeit catheter-related complications resulted after treatment discontinuation. Studies report the use of HIPEC predominantly in the setting of recurrent disease and have demonstrated encouraging results, which merits further investigation in future clinical trials \n  The combination of SCR and HIPEC seems to improve survival rate in patients suffering from platinum-sensitive EOC recurrence with respect to no-HIPEC treatments. This result further supports the need of a randomized trial \n  Cautious extrapolation of data from standard normothermic, nonintraoperative, intraperitoneal chemotherapy and data from Phase II and nonrandomized comparative studies suggest that HIPEC delivered at the time of surgery for ovarian cancer has definite potential \n The available evidence suggests that a potential survival benefit of adding HIPEC may be largest in the settings of secondary CRS for stage III ovarian cancer and salvage CRS for recurrent ovarian cancer, two time-points representing failure of initial standard therapy. There is much less evidence for a potential benefit of HIPEC for less advanced stages (I-II) and for earlier time-points in the treatment of ovarian cancer (upfront, interval and consolidation) \n Survival benefit of adding Hyperthermic IntraPEritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) at the different time-points of treatment of ovarian cancer \n Patients suffering from peritoneal recurrence of ovarian cancer should be considered for radical reoperation with HIPEC in a center with expertise in multimodal therapeutic options. Organ-preserving cytoreductive surgery allows complete cytoreduction with the goal of decreasing morbidity \n  In recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients, the use of CRS plus HIPEC represents a safe treatment, able to significantly influence the survival rates compared to chemotherapy alone or surgery plus standard chemotherapy \n  The results of our study indicate the feasibility and the potential benefit of a protocol including systemic chemotherapy, surgical cytoreduction and HIPEC in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from ovarian cancer. A phase III trial to compare this approach with conventional treatment is needed \n In selected patients with heavily pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer, cytoreduction combined with HIPEC may provide a meaningful OS with acceptable morbidity. Optimal results are achieved in patients with a macroscopically complete resection and biologically favorable disease \n  HIPEC is a complement to radical surgery/ peritonectomy, which has been shown to be a surgical procedure with high tolerability, low morbimortality, enhanced survival and prolonged disease-free interval in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis for recurrent ovarian cancer \n  Despite the heterogeneity of the studies reviewed, current evidence suggest that complete CRS and HIPEC may be a feasible option with potential benefits that are comparable with the current standard of care. A randomized trial is required to establish the role of HIPEC in ovarian cancer \n in the majority of patients with primary and recurrent advanced ovarian cancer, cytoreductive surgery combined with HIPEC can lead to a substantial increase in subsequent rates of disease-free and overall survival \n  Peritonectomy procedures combined with HIPEC offer promising long-term survival in patients with diffuse peritoneal ovarian carcinomatosis.

        "question": "An integrated model describing the interaction of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents with reversible anticholinesterase agents is derived and compared with a naive model using experimental data obtained from four anesthetized dogs. Three consecutive but separate steady-state d-tubocurarine blocks (approximately 50, 70, and 90%) were induced in each of the four dogs and reversed by short edrophonium infusions. \n The ability of hexamethonium (C6) to reverse the neuromuscular blocking action of tubocurarine (Tc) \n Volatile anesthetics enhance the neuromuscular blockade produced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (NDMRs). The neuromuscular junction is a postulated site of this interaction. We tested the hypothesis that volatile anesthetic enhancement of muscle relaxation is the result of combined drug effects on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. \n Concentration-effect curves for the inhibition of acetylcholine-induced currents were established for vecuronium, d-tubocurarine, isoflurane, and sevoflurane. Subsequently, inhibitory effects of NDMRs were studied in the presence of the volatile anesthetics at a concentration equivalent to half the concentration producing a 50% inhibition alone. All individually tested compounds produced rapid and readily reversible concentration-dependent inhibition. \n The pharmacological diversity of the different isoforms of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor arises from the diversity of the subunits that assemble to form the native receptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors \n At all three receptor types, d-tubocurarine and pancuronium blocked the responses elicited by acetylcholine in a reversible manner.  \n As further evidence of anticholinesterase activity, methamidophos (1-100 microM) was able to reverse the blockade by d-tubocurarine \n There was an initial partial reversal of the neuromuscular inhibition caused by tubocurarine \n Isoflurane and sevoflurane enhance the receptor blocking effects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. \n Because other purinergic 2X (P2X) receptor antagonists, NF023 and NF279, do not have the reverse effects on the neuromuscular blockade of d-TC, the effect of NF449 seems irrelevant to inhibition of P2X receptors. \n The association rate constant for Tc binding to sites on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor appears to be very fast (k+D = 8.9 x 10(8) M-1 s-1) and comparable to that for acetylcholine (ACh). \n The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism for the reversal effect of NF449 (a suramin analogue) on the neuromuscular block induced by d-tubocurarine (d-TC). \n The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism for the reversal effect of NF449 (a suramin analogue) on the neuromuscular block induced by d-tubocurarine (d-TC). \n The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism for the reversal effect of NF449 (a suramin analogue) on the neuromuscular block induced by d-tubocurarine (d-TC). \n Study of the reversal effect of NF449 on neuromuscular blockade induced by d-tubocurarine. \n The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism for the reversal effect of NF449 (a suramin analogue) on the neuromuscular block induced by d-tubocurarine (d-TC). \n Does d-tubocurarine (d-TC) induces irreversible inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction?",

        "question": "CONCLUSION: Endometriomas per se appear to be the main cause of the reduced long-term reproductive performance of the affected patients, with little or no contribution from surgery. Furthermore, endometrioma surgery seems to improve the success rates of fertility treatment. \n Amongst the 38 women desiring pregnancy after endometrioma surgery, 19 (50%) achieved a spontaneous pregnancy during the follow-up period.  \n Of 33 women who wished to conceive, 67% became pregnant, spontaneously in 59% \n CONCLUSIONS: Recurrence and pregnancy rates are encouraging in that they seem comparable to the best reported results after endometrioma cystectomy.  \n While laparoscopic excision is known to improve fertility, recurrence can cause significant ovarian damage and adverse affects on fertility. \n Surgery is considered to play a role within the framework of the therapeutic options to cure infertile women with the disease even though its effectiveness is generally modest.  \n Randomized controlled trials showed that the excision technique is associated with a higher pregnancy rate and a lower rate of recurrence although it may determine severe injury to the ovarian reserve.  \n Surgical treatment is associated with a high recurrence rate and its employment for women undergoing assisted conception has recently been challenged. \n Laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometrioma prior to IVF does not offer any additional benefit over expectant management.  \n For those women subsequently attempting to conceive it was also associated with a subsequent increased spontaneous pregnancy rate in women who had documented prior sub-fertility (OR 5.21 CI 2.04-13.29). \n here is insufficient evidence to favour excisional surgery over ablative surgery with respect to the chance of pregnancy after controlled ovarian stimulation and intra-uterine insemination (OR 1.40 CI 0.47-4.15) .  \n CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in a context of more than one year infertility only related to endometriosis, it is reasonable to offer these patients a complete operative laparoscopic treatment of their lesions, which enables 65% of them to be pregnant within a 8.5 months post-surgical median time to pregnancy and spontaneously in 60%.  \n  It was also associated with a subsequent increased rate of spontaneous pregnancy women who had documented prior sub-fertility (OR 5.21 CI 2.04-13.29). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that excisional surgery for endometriomata provides for a more favourable outcome than drainage and ablation, with regard to the recurrence of the endometrioma, recurrence of symptoms and subsequent spontaneous pregnancy in women who were previously subfertile.  \n Surgery is an option for treatment, but there is no convincing evidence that it promotes a significant improvement in fertility. \n In conclusion, ovarian surgery for the treatment of endometriosis reduces the ovarian outcome in IVF/ICSI cycles in women >35 years old, and might also decrease pregnancy rates.  \n Improvement of pain symptoms occurred in 87% of the patients and fertility rate was 45%. \n The long-term results, especially the fertility outcome, have been promising: 12 of 20 women (60%) achieved a term pregnancy following a laparoscopic endometrioma procedure alone.  \n Among this group, 115 patients (54%) conceived following surgery; of these conceptions, 109 resulted in a living child. \n WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Despite the available evidence that surgery for endometriomas does not improve the outcome of ART and may damage ovarian reserve, it seems that the majority of gynaecologists in the UK offer ovarian cystectomy to their patients. \n CONCLUSION: Endometriomas per se appear to be the main cause of the reduced long-term reproductive performance of the affected patients, with little or no contribution from surgery.

        "question": "CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid pain syndromes, mood conditions and asthma are common in adolescents and young women with endometriosis. \n There are many etiologies of pelvic pain that present with symptoms resembling those of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain that are not diagnosable with laparoscopy, such as interstitial cystitis and irritable bowel syndrome. \n Often, such patients are labelled with irritable bowel syndrome.  \n Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis.  \n RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with minimal to mild and moderate to severe endometriosis had a higher prevalence of symptoms consistent with IBS (0% vs 65% and 50%, respectively, p<0.001) with significantly lower mean pain thresholds (39.5 mm\u2002Hg (95% CI 36.0 to 43.0) vs 28.1 mm\u2002Hg (95% CI 24.5 to 31.6), p=0.001 and 28.8 mm\u2002Hg (95% CI 24.9 to 32.6), p=0.002) not explained by differences in rectal compliance.  \n Similarly, women with a history of irritable bowel syndrome were twice as likely to develop endometriosis [AOR=1.9, 95% CI (1.03-3.87)]. \n A weak association between reported family history of endometriosis and history of irritable bowel syndrome and the development of endometriosis was also observed.  \n Irritable bowel syndrome and chronic constipation in patients with endometriosis. \n Fifteen per cent of the patients with endometriosis also had IBS and 14% of the patients with endometriosis had functional constipation without IBS. \n CONCLUSION: In patients with endometriosis, 29% also had IBS or constipation.  \n Seventy-six women (21.4%) had previously been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and 79% of them had endometriosis confirmed. \n Compared with controls, women with endometriosis had increased risks of abdominopelvic pain (OR 5.2 [95% CI: 4.7-5.7]), dysmenorrhoea (OR 8.1 [95% CI: 7.2-9.3]), menorrhagia (OR 4.0 [95% CI: 3.5-4.5]), subfertility (OR 8.2 [95% CI: 6.9-9.9]), dyspareunia and/or postcoital bleeding (OR 6.8 [95% CI: 5.7-8.2]), and ovarian cysts (OR 7.3 [95% CI: 5.7-9.4]), and of being diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (OR 1.6 [95% CI: 1.3-1.8]) or pelvic inflammatory disease (OR 3.0 [95% CI: 2.5-3.6]). \n Endometriosis may coexist with or be misdiagnosed as pelvic inflammatory disease or IBS. \n RESULTS: Compared with the controls, women with endometriosis were 3.5 times more likely to have received a diagnosis of IBS (OR 3.5 [95% CI: 3.1-3.9]). Even after women had been diagnosed with endometriosis, they were still two and a half times more likely to receive a new diagnosis of IBS when compared with the controls (OR 2.5 [95% CI: 2.2-2.8]). \n CONCLUSIONS: Women with endometriosis are more likely to be diagnosed with IBS and PID than controls, even after a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis has been reached. \n In women, clinical studies suggest that functional pain syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and fibromyalgia, are co-morbid with endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain, and others diseases. \n In women, clinical studies suggest that pain syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome and interstitial cystitis, which are associated with visceral hyperalgesia, are often comorbid with endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain.  \n Depression, anxiety, IBS, FM, CFS, and IC were more common in migraine with EM group than in controls. \n Intestinal endometriosis can mimic many gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, infections and neoplasms. \n Endometriosis is often associated with other painful conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis and fibromyalgia.  \n CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of endometriosis should be considered in women with recurrent monthly abdominal pain and bowel symptoms, especially if accompanied by gynaecologic complaints, even because the significant symptoms overlap with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and makes the differentiation extremely difficult. \n Intestinal endometriosis is typically asymptomatic; however, when symptoms occur, they can mimic those of irritable bowel syndrome. \n  Similarly, women with a history of irritable bowel syndrome were twice as likely to develop endometriosis [AOR=1. \n Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis. \n CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of endometriosis should be considered in women with recurrent monthly abdominal pain and bowel symptoms, especially if accompanied by gynaecologic complaints, even because the significant symptoms overlap with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and makes the differentiation extremely difficult. \n There are many etiologies of pelvic pain that present with symptoms resembling those of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain that are not diagnosable with laparoscopy, such as interstitial cystitis and irritable bowel syndrome. \n Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis. \n Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis. \n Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis. \n Is irritable bowel syndrome more common in women with endometriosis?",

In patients with excessive sleepiness associated with shift work disorder, treated obstructive sleep apnoea, or narcolepsy, armodafinil has been found to improve wakefulness throughout the shift or day. In addition, while not approved for this indication, armodafinil has been found to improve excessive sleepiness associated with jet-lag disorder. \n STUDY OBJECTIVES: Armodafinil is a wakefulness-promoting medication. Its efficacy and tolerability have been established in 12-week studies of patients with excessive sleepiness (ES) associated with treated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), shift work disorder (SWD), or narcolepsy.  \n Armodafinil represents an option for long-term treatment of patients with ES associated with treated OSA, SWD, or narcolepsy. \n The wakefulness-promoting agents armodafinil and modafinil are FDA approved for the treatment of ES in patients with SWD. \n CONCLUSIONS: Armodafinil significantly improved overall clinical condition related to excessive sleepiness as rated by the CGI-C and was well tolerated in patients with treated OSA and comorbid depression. \n CONCLUSION: In patients with excessive sleepiness associated with chronic SWD of moderate or greater severity, armodafinil significantly improved wakefulness during scheduled night work, raising mean nighttime sleep latency above the level considered to indicate severe sleepiness during the daytime. Armodafinil also significantly improved measures of overall clinical condition, long-term memory, and attention.  \n Adjunct treatment with armodafinil significantly improved wakefulness, long-term memory, and patients' ability to engage in activities of daily living in nCPAP-adherent individuals with ES associated with OSA.  \n A number of studies have evaluated countermeasures or interventions in shift workers; proposed treatments include chronobiotic interventions, such as light exposure, melatonin, hypnotic agents, caffeine and CNS stimulants (amphetamine), and the wake-promoting agents modafinil and armodafinil.  \n These studies showed that modafinil and armodafinil significantly improve the ability to sustain wakefulness during waking activities (e.g. working, driving), overall clinical condition, and sustained attention or memory in patients with SWSD.  \n CONCLUSIONS: In this selected population of patients with OSA/HS and residual ES despite effective treatment with nCPAP, armodafinil QD used as an adjunct to nCPAP treatment was associated with improved wakefulness and overall clinical condition.  \n  Other therapies, such as sedative hypnotics, target daytime insomnia, while pharmacologic agents such as modafinil, armodafinil, and caffeine and non-pharmacologic approaches such as napping promote nighttime alertness. \n  Other therapies, such as sedative hypnotics, target daytime insomnia, while pharmacologic agents such as modafinil, armodafinil, and caffeine and non-pharmacologic approaches such as napping promote nighttime alertness. \n Armodafinil represents an option for long-term treatment of patients with ES associated with treated OSA, SWD, or narcolepsy. \n The wakefulness-promoting agents armodafinil and modafinil are FDA approved for the treatment of ES in patients with SWD. \n Other therapies, such as sedative hypnotics, target daytime insomnia, while pharmacologic agents such as modafinil, armodafinil, and caffeine and non-pharmacologic approaches such as napping promote nighttime alertness. \n In this selected population of patients with OSA/HS and residual ES despite effective treatment with nCPAP, armodafinil QD used as an adjunct to nCPAP treatment was associated with improved wakefulness and overall clinical condition \n Other therapies, such as sedative hypnotics, target daytime insomnia, while pharmacologic agents such as modafinil, armodafinil, and caffeine and non-pharmacologic approaches such as napping promote nighttime alertness. \n In this selected population of patients with OSA/HS and residual ES despite effective treatment with nCPAP, armodafinil QD used as an adjunct to nCPAP treatment was associated with improved wakefulness and overall clinical condition \n Other therapies, such as sedative hypnotics, target daytime insomnia, while pharmacologic agents such as modafinil, armodafinil, and caffeine and non-pharmacologic approaches such as napping promote nighttime alertness. \n In this selected population of patients with OSA/HS and residual ES despite effective treatment with nCPAP, armodafinil QD used as an adjunct to nCPAP treatment was associated with improved wakefulness and overall clinical condition \n Other therapies, such as sedative hypnotics, target daytime insomnia, while pharmacologic agents such as modafinil, armodafinil, and caffeine and non-pharmacologic approaches such as napping promote nighttime alertness. \n Is armodafinil used for treatment of insomnia?",

        "question": "The synergistic effect of miR-21 and miR-1 were functionally validated for their significant influences on myocardial apoptosis, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. \n Taken together, we found a novel reciprocal loop between miR-21 and TGF\u03b2RIII in cardiac fibrosis caused by myocardial infarction in mice, and targeting this pathway could be a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of myocardial remodeling. \n It is still controversial whether microRNA-21 (miR-21) participates in the process of cardiac fibrosis. \n In mice, myocardial miR-21 overexpression is related to cardiac fibrosis elicited by pressure overload.  \n The myocardial and plasma levels of miR-21 were significantly higher in the AS patients compared with the controls and correlated directly with the echocardiographic mean transvalvular gradients. \n Our results support the role of miR-21 as a regulator of the fibrotic process that occurs in response to pressure overload in AS patients and underscore the value of circulating miR-21 as a biomarker for myocardial fibrosis. \n Ad-miR-21 improves LV remodeling and decreases the apoptosis of myocardial cells, suggesting the possible mechanism by which Ad-miR-21 functions in protecting against I/R injury. \n In the Ad-miR-21 group, LV dimensions, myocardial infarct size, LV/BW, collagen type \u2160, type \u2162 and PCNA positive cells all significantly decreased compared with the Ad-GFP group. \n While miR-21, -133, -150, -195, and -214 regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, miR-1/-133 and miR-208 have been elucidated to influence myocardial contractile function. In addition, miR-21, -24, -133, -210, -494, and -499 appear to protect myocytes against I/R-induced apoptosis, whereas miR-1, -29, -199a, and -320 promote apoptosis. Myocardial fibrosis can be regulated by the miR-29 family and miR-21. \n The small regulatory RNA microRNA-21 (miR-21) plays a crucial role in a plethora of biological functions and diseases including development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and inflammation. \n During recent years, additional roles of miR-21 in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, including cardiac and pulmonary fibrosis as well as myocardial infarction have been described. \n On the other hand, miR-21, miR-199a, miR-210, and miR-494 have been proven critical for the myocytes' adaptation and survival during hypoxia/ischemia.  \n Studies have shown that several miRs, including miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-126, miR-320, miR-92a, and miR-199a, are regulated after preconditioning and play an active role in protecting the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury. \n Studies using various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models have suggested the possible involvement of miR-1, miR-21, miR-29, miR-92a, miR-133, miR-199a, and miR-320 in ischemia-reperfusion injury and/or remodeling after myocardial infarction. \n MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system. Recent studies have revealed that its expression is deregulated in heart and vasculature under cardiovascular disease conditions such as proliferative vascular disease, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. miR-21 is found to play important roles in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis, cardiac cell growth and death, and cardiac fibroblast functions. Accordingly, miR-21 is proven to be involved in the pathogenesis of the above-mentioned cardiovascular diseases as demonstrated by both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. \n miR-21 might be a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases. \n This review article summarizes the research progress regarding the roles of miR-21 in cardiovascular disease. \n Remarkably, miR-21 was one of most upregulated miRNAs in hearts after IP. In vivo, IP-mediated cardiac protection against ischaemia/reperfusion injury was inhibited by knockdown of cardiac miR-21. In cultured cardiac myocytes, we identified that miR-21 also had a protective effect on hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell apoptosis that was associated with its target gene, programmed cell death 4. The protective effect of miR-21 on cardiac cell apoptosis was further confirmed in rat hearts after ischaemia/reperfusion injury in vivo. \n Lately, some highlight articles revealed that the altered expression of miRNAs such as miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-208 etc in hearts also contributed to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and arrhythmias. \n Remarkably, miR-21 expression was significantly down-regulated in infarcted areas, but was up-regulated in border areas. The down-regulation of miR-21 in the infarcted areas was inhibited by ischemic preconditioning, a known cardiac protective method. Overexpression of miR-21 via adenovirus expressing miR-21 (Ad-miR-21) decreased myocardial infarct size by 29% at 24 h and decreased the dimension of left ventricles at 2 weeks after AMI. Using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in cultured cardiac myocytes, we identified that miR-21 had a protective effect on ischemia-induced cell apoptosis that was associated with its target gene programmed cell death 4 and activator protein 1 pathway. The protective effect of miR-21 against ischemia-induced cardiac myocyte damage was further confirmed in vivo by decreased cell apoptosis in the border and infarcted areas of the infarcted rat hearts after treatment with Ad-miR-21. The results suggest that miRNAs such as miR-21 may play critical roles in the early phase of AMI. \n The results suggest that miR-21 is sensitive to H(2)O(2) stimulation. miR-21 participates in H(2)O(2)-mediated gene regulation and functional modulation in cardiac myocytes. miR-21 might play an essential role in heart diseases related to ROS such as cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. \n MicroRNA-21 contributes to myocardial disease by stimulating MAP kinase signalling in fibroblasts \n Myocardial and circulating levels of microRNA-21 reflect left ventricular fibrosis in aortic stenosis patients \n MicroRNA 21 inhibits left ventricular remodeling in the early phase of rat model with ischemia-reperfusion injury by suppressing cell apoptosis \n MicroRNA-21 protects against the H(2)O(2)-induced injury on cardiac myocytes via its target gene PDCD4 \n MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system. \n MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system. \n MicroRNA-21 contributes to myocardial disease by stimulating MAP kinase signalling in fibroblasts. \n MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system \n miR-21 might be a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases \n MicroRNA-21 contributes to myocardial disease by stimulating MAP kinase signalling in fibroblasts. \n MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system \n MicroRNA-21 contributes to myocardial disease by stimulating MAP kinase signalling in fibroblasts. \n MicroRNA-21 contributes to myocardial disease by stimulating MAP kinase signalling in fibroblasts. \n MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system \n MicroRNA-21 as therapeutic target in cancer and cardiovascular disease. \n These findings reveal that microRNAs can contribute to myocardial disease by an effect in cardiac fibroblasts. \n Our results validate miR-21 as a disease target in heart failure and establish the therapeutic efficacy of microRNA therapeutic intervention in a cardiovascular disease setting. \n Does MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) contribute to cardiovascular disease?",

        "question": "A human genetic variant (Ser96Ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding (HRC) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy.  \n These findings suggest that aberrant SR Ca2+ release and increased susceptibility to delayed afterdepolarizations underlie triggered arrhythmic activity in human Ala96 HRC carriers. \n The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers. \n These findings indicate that the HRC Ser96Ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers. \n HRC plays an important role in myocyte differentiation and in antiapoptotic cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion induced cardiac injury. Interestingly, HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. \n This review summarizes studies, which have established the critical role of HRC in Ca(2+)-homeostasis, suggesting its importance in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. \n HRC is a SR luminal Ca(2+) binding protein known to associate with both triadin and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, and may thus mediate the crosstalk between SR Ca(2+) uptake and release. Indeed, evidence from genetic models of JCN and HRC indicate that they are important in cardiophysiology as alterations in these proteins affect SR Ca(2+) handling and cardiac function. In addition, downregulation of JCN and HRC may contribute to Ca(2+) cycling perturbations manifest in the failing heart, where their protein levels are significantly reduced. \n The Ser96Ala genetic variant of HRC is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic DCM and may serve as an independent predictor of susceptibility to arrhythmogenesis in the setting of DCM. \n AAV-mediated knock-down of HRC exacerbates transverse aorta constriction-induced heart failure. \n Chronic overexpression of HRC that may disrupt intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis is implicated in pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy \n Ablation of HRC showed relatively normal phenotypes under basal condition, but exhibited a significantly increased susceptibility to isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy \n Our results present evidence that down-regulation of HRC could deteriorate cardiac function in TAC-FH through perturbed SR-mediated Ca(2+) cycling \n However, AAV9-mediated HRC-KD in TAC-FH was associated with decreased fractional shortening and increased cardiac fibrosis compared with control. \n Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is a high capacity, low affinity Ca(2+) binding protein, specifically expressed in striated muscles of mammals. In rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscles, HRC binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes via triadin, a junctional SR protein. Recently, a potential role in heart failure and arrhythmogenesis has been assigned to HRC due to its activity as regulator of SR Ca(2+) uptake and Ca(2+) release. \n In addition, HRC null mice displayed a significantly exaggerated response to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy by isoproterenol compared to their wild-type littermates. The exaggerated response of HRC knockout mice to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy is consistent with a regulatory role for HRCBP in calcium handling in vivo and suggests that mutations in HRC, in combination with other genetic or environmental factors, might contribute to pathological hypertrophy and heart failure. \n We observed that the levels of HRC were reduced in animal models and human heart failure. \n Collectively, these data indicate that alterations in expression levels of HRC are associated with impaired cardiac SR Ca homeostasis and contractile function. \n The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers. \n Abnormal calcium cycling and cardiac arrhythmias associated with the human Ser96Ala genetic variant of histidine-rich calcium-binding protein. \n The Ser96Ala variant in histidine-rich calcium-binding protein is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. \n The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers. \n The Ser96Ala variant in histidine-rich calcium-binding protein is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. \n A human genetic variant (Ser96Ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding (HRC) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy.  \n The Ser96Ala variant in histidine-rich calcium-binding protein is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. \n The Ser96Ala variant in histidine-rich calcium-binding protein is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. \n Interestingly, HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy \n Is the Histidine-Rich Calcium Binding protein (HRC) related to arrhythmias and cardiac disease?",

Pr \n Survey adjusted multivariable logistic regression assessed classification of 12-month, depression-related presenteeism on the basis of socio-demographic, financial, work and health factors.  \n RESULTS: The LPT from absenteeism and presenteeism (reduced performance while present at work) was significantly higher among the MDD group. \n BACKGROUND: Depression is reported to be a major cause of illness-related sub-optimal work performance (presenteeism).  \n BACKGROUND: It is amply documented that mood disorders adversely affect job satisfaction, workforce productivity, and absenteeism/presenteeism.  \n The difference in productivity loss due to impaired presenteeism was significantly different between the two groups, but the productivity loss due to absenteeism was not.  \n Disease activity (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.11-9.48) and depression (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.22-8.48) were associated with absenteeism, while depression (OR 5.69, 95% CI 1.77-18.27, disease activity (OR 3.97, 95% CI 1.76-8.98), anxiety (OR 3.90, 95% CI 1.83-8.31), self-efficacy (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.86), and increasing age (OR 1.04 per year, 95% CI 1.00-1.08) were associated with presenteeism.  \n Depression, in particular, appears to be associated with employment, absenteeism, and presenteeism, and should therefore be prioritized in clinical practice. \n Depression frequently causes unemployment, absenteeism, and presenteeism, which results in significantly reduced productivity. \n Presenteeism and absenteeism were significantly worse for the depression group at each time point (p < or = .001). In cross-sectional models, presenteeism was associated with more severe depression symptoms, poorer general physical health, psychologically demanding work, the interaction ofpsychologically demanding work with depression, and less job control (r2 range = .33-.54). \n Chronic conditions such as depression/anxiety, obesity, arthritis, and back/neck pain are especially important causes of productivity loss. Comorbidities have significant non-additive effects on both absenteeism and presenteeism. \n RESULTS: At baseline, all presenteeism measures were sensitive to differences between those with (N=69) and without (N=363) depression/anxiety. \n Depression and anxiety were more consistently associated with \"presenteeism\" (that is, lost productivity while at work) than with absenteeism, whether this was measured by cutback days or by direct questionnaires. \n RESULTS: Substantial research exists about anxiety and depression costs, such as performance and productivity, absenteeism, presenteeism, disability, physical disability exacerbation, mental health treatment, increased medical care costs, exacerbating of physical illness, and studies of mental health care limitations and cost-offset. \n The author discusses the etiology and potential solutions for managing this new component in the productivity equation and in addressing depression, the major contributor to presenteeism. \n For employees who are currently depressed, recent research evidence has demonstrated that pharmacotherapy can have a dramatic and positive effect on lost productivity, absenteeism, and presenteeism. \n Among participants who were still employed, those with depression had significantly more job turnover, presenteeism, and absenteeism.  \n Only depression affected both absenteeism-presenteeism and critical incidents.  \n CONCLUSIONS: Depressive disorders in the workplace persist over time and have a major effect on work performance, most notably on \"presenteeism,\" or reduced effectiveness in the workplace.  \n The negative effects of depression include those on patients' occupational functioning, including absenteeism, presenteeism, and reduced opportunities for educational and work success.  \n The remitted group demonstrated a significant improvement in productivity (particularly presenteeism) when compared with the new visit group (Z\u2009=\u2009-3.29, p\u2009=\u20090.001). \n Depression in workers leads to significant absenteeism, \"presenteeism\" (diminished capacity due to illness while still present at work), and significantly increased medical expenses in addition to the costs of psychiatric care.  \n Significant predictors of presenteeism and activity impairment at follow-up (controlled for gender, age, spondyloarthritis subgroups and presenteeism at baseline) were presenteeism at baseline, poor quality of life, worse disease activity, decreased physical function, lower self-efficacy pain and symptom, higher scores of anxiety, depression, smoking and low education level, and for activity impairment also female sex.  \n \" Pain and depression were significantly associated with presenteeism. \n RESULTS: At baseline, all presenteeism measures were sensitive to differences between those with (N=69) and without (N=363) depression/anxiety. \n Presenteeism was positively associated with severity of depression (Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, P < 0.0001; WPAI, P < 0.0001). \n Statistically significant correlations (0.32-0.53) were found between presenteeism and increasing disability, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life.  \n Only depression affected both absenteeism-presenteeism and critical incidents. \n Factors with less contribution to presenteeism included physical limitations, depression or anxiety, inadequate job training, and problems with supervisors and coworkers. \n The author discusses the etiology and potential solutions for managing this new component in the productivity equation and in addressing depression, the major contributor to presenteeism. \n Is there an association between presenteeism and depression?",

        "question": "Muscle LIM protein (MLP) has been proposed to be a central player in the pathogenesis of heart muscle disease. In line with this notion, the homozygous loss of MLP results in cardiac hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy. Moreover, MLP is induced in several models of cardiac hypertrophy such as aortic banding and myocardial infarction.  \n Muscle LIM protein (MLP) null mice are often used as a model for human dilated cardiomyopathy. \n A lack of MLP leads to an age-dependent impairment of excitation-contraction coupling with resulting contractile dysfunction and secondary fibrosis. \n Loss of murine MLP results in dilated cardiomyopathy, and mutations in human MLP lead to cardiac hypertrophy, indicating a critical role for MLP in maintaining normal cardiac function. \n Our data indicate that MLP contributes to muscle stiffness and is necessary for maximum work and power generation. \n Interestingly, MLP was also found to be down-regulated in humans with heart failure (Zolk et al. Circulation 101:2674-2677, 2000) and MLP mutations are able to cause hypertrophic and dilated forms of cardiomyopathy in humans (Bos et al. Mol Genet Metab 88:78-85, 2006; Geier et al. Circulation 107:1390-1395, 2003; Hershberger et al. Clin Transl Sci 1:21-26, 2008; Kn\u00f6ll et al. Cell 111:943-955, 2002; Kn\u00f6ll et al. Circ Res 106:695-704, 2010; Mohapatra et al. Mol Genet Metab 80:207-215, 2003). \n MLP soon became an important model for experimental cardiology when it was first demonstrated that MLP deficiency leads to myocardial hypertrophy followed by a dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure phenotype (Arber et al. Cell 88:393-403, 1997).  \n Previous studies have shown an association between CSRP3 missense mutations and either dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or HCM, but all these studies were unable to provide comprehensive genetic evidence for a causative role of CSRP3 mutations.  \n We used a newly designed monoclonal antibody to show that muscle LIM protein (MLP), the protein encoded by CSRP3, is mainly a cytosolic component of cardiomyocytes and not tightly anchored to sarcomeric structures. Our functional data from both in vitro and in vivo analyses suggest that at least one of MLP's mutated forms seems to be destabilized in the heart of HCM patients harbouring a CSRP3 missense mutation. \n Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a cytoskeletal protein located at the Z-disc of sarcomeres. Mutations in the human MLP gene are associated with hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. \n Our data demonstrate that Mlp84B is essential for normal cardiac function and establish the Drosophila model for the investigation of the mechanisms connecting defective cardiac Z-disc components to the development of cardiomyopathy. \n Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a cytoskeletal LIM-only protein expressed in striated muscle. Mutations in human MLP are associated with cardiomyopathy; \n TTN-encoded titin, CSRP3-encoded muscle LIM protein, and TCAP-encoded telethonin are Z-disc proteins essential for the structural organization of the cardiac sarcomere and the cardiomyocyte's stretch sensor. All three genes have been established as cardiomyopathy-associated genes for both dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).  \n Approximately 4.1% of unrelated patients had HCM-associated MLP or TCAP mutations. MLP/TCAP-HCM phenotypically mirrors myofilament-HCM and is more severe than the subset of patients who still remain without a disease-causing mutation. The precise role of W4R-MLP in the pathogenesis of either DCM or HCM warrants further investigation. \n MLP (muscle-LIM-protein) deficient mice develop DCM and changes in the mechanical coupling of cardiomyocytes result in alterations at the intercalated disks and enhanced accumulation of adherens junction proteins. \n Targeted deletion of cytoskeletal muscle LIM protein (MLP) in mice consistently leads to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) after one or more months.  \n In summary, young MLPKO mice revealed substantial alterations in passive myocardial properties and relaxation time, but not in most systolic characteristics. These results indicate that the progression to heart failure in the MLPKO model may be driven by diastolic myocardial dysfunction and abnormal passive properties rather than systolic dysfunction. \n Mice lacking the muscle LIM protein (MLP) develop morphological and clinical signs resembling human dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. \n Our results show that the absence of MLP causes a local loss of mitochondria. We hypothesize that this is caused by a disturbed interaction between cytoskeleton and mitochondria, which interferes with energy sensing and energy transfer. Recovery of energy depletion by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis might be a useful therapeutic strategy for improving the energy imbalance in heart failure. \n Previous work has shown that mutations in muscle LIM protein (MLP) can cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In order to gain an insight into the molecular basis of the disease phenotype, we analysed the binding characteristics of wild-type MLP and of the (C58G) mutant MLP that causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n The molecular basis for HCM-causing mutations in the MLP gene might therefore be an alteration in the equilibrium of interactions of the ternary complex MLP-N-RAP-alpha-actinin. \n Muscle LIM protein (MLP) is a member of the cysteine-rich protein (CRP) family and has been implicated in both myogenesis and sarcomere assembly. In the latter role, it binds zyxin and alpha-actinin, both of which are involved in actin organization. An MLP-deficient mouse has been described; these mice develop dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. \n We identified a patient with DCM and EFE, having a mutation in MLP with the residue lysine 69 substituted by arginine (K69R).  \n MLP-knockout mice develop a marked cardiac hypertrophy reaction and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). MLP is therefore a candidate gene for heritable forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and DCM in humans. \n Family studies revealed cosegregation of clinically affected individuals with the respective mutations in MLP. CONCLUSION: Here, we present evidence that mutations in the CRP3/MLP gene can cause HCM. \n The skeletal muscle LIM protein 1 (SLIM1) is highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and its expression is downregulated significantly in dilated human cardiomyopathy.  \n Targeted disruption of muscle LIM protein (MLP) has previously been shown to result in dilated cardiomyopathy with many of the clinical signs of heart failure, although the effects of MLP disruption on passive ventricular mechanics and myocyte architecture are not known. \n These results suggest that the disruption of the cytoskeletal protein MLP results in less compliant passive tissue and concomitant structural alterations in the three-dimensional myocyte architecture that may in part explain the ventricular dysfunction in the dilated heart. \n  Mutations in cysteine and glycine-rich protein 3 (CSRP3), the gene encoding MLP, have been directly associated with human cardiomyopathies, whereas aberrant expression patterns are reported in human cardiac and skeletal muscle diseases. \n Muscle LIM protein (MLP) has been proposed to be a central player in the pathogenesis of heart muscle disease. \n Muscle LIM protein (MLP) has been proposed to be a central player in the pathogenesis of heart muscle disease.

        "question": "Gene expression regulation through the interplay of DNA methylation and histone modifications is well-established, although the knowledge about the function of epigenetic signatures in cardiovascular disease is still largely unexplored. \n The study of epigenetic markers is, therefore, a very promising frontier of science which may aid in a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of gene expression in the biomolecule pathways linked to cardiovascular diseases. \n This review highlights our current knowledge of epigenetic gene regulation and the evidence that chromatin remodeling and histone modifications play key roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease through (re)programming of cardiovascular (stem) cells commitment, identity and function. \n Notably, multiple subunits of switching defective/sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling complexes have been identified as strong candidates underlying these defects because they physically and functionally interact with cardiogenic transcription factors critical to cardiac development, such as TBX5, GATA-4, and NKX2-5. While these studies indicate a critical role of SWI/SNF complexes in cardiac development and congenital heart disease, many exciting new discoveries have identified their critical role in the adult heart in both physiological and pathological conditions involving multiple cell types in the heart, including cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and neural crest cells. \n Recent studies have greatly expanded our understanding of the regulation of cardiovascular development at the chromatin level, including the remodeling of chromatin and the modification of histones. Chromatin-level regulation integrates multiple inputs and coordinates broad gene expression programs. Thus, understanding chromatin-level regulation will allow for a better appreciation of gene regulation as a whole and may set a fundamental basis for cardiovascular disease. \n Genetic and epigenetic factors are of great importance in cardiovascular biology and disease. Tobacco-smoking, one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors, is itself partially determined by genetic background and is associated with altered epigenetic patterns. \n Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification (acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation) and miRNA, are critical for regulating developmental events. However, aberrant epigenetic mechanisms may lead to pathological consequences such as cardiovascular disease (CAD), neurodegenerative disease, obesity, metabolic disorder, bone and skeletal diseases and various cancers. \n Cardiovascular disease pathways are now being approached from the epigenetic perspective, including those associated with atherosclerosis, angiogenesis, ischemia-reperfusion damage, and the cardiovascular response to hypoxia and shear stress, among many others. With increasing interest and expanding partnerships in the field, we can expect new insights to emerge from epigenetic perspectives of cardiovascular health. \n Epigenetic modifications are heritable alterations of the genome, which can govern gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. The purpose of this review is to render an overview of the possible mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of gene expression in response to environmental pollutants leading to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). \n From varied study approaches directed either toward the general understanding of the key pathway regulatory genes, or sampling population cohorts for global and gene-specific changes, it has been possible to identify several epigenetic signatures of environmental exposure relevant to CVD. \n An understanding of chromatin remodelling in response to environmental stimuli conducive to CVD is emerging, with the promise of novel diagnostic and therapeutic candidates. \n Consolidated knowledge is accumulating as to the role of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in the physiology of vascular development and vascular tone as well as in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The modulation of gene expression through modification of the epigenome by structural changes of the chromatin architecture without alterations of the associated genomic DNA sequence is part of the cellular response to environmental changes. Such environmental conditions, which are finally being translated into adaptations of the cardiovascular system, also comprise pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis or myocardial infarction.  \n Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease. Histone modifications lead to the modulation of the expression of genetic information through modification of DNA accessibility. In addition, RNA-based mechanisms (e.g., microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) influence the development of disease. \n We here outline the recent work pertaining to epigenetic changes in a cardiovascular disease setting. \n Epigenetics may represent one of the possible scientific explanations of the impact of such intrauterine risk factors for the subsequent development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) during adulthood. \n Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA alterations, which collectively enable the cell to respond quickly to environmental changes. A number of CVD risk factors, such as nutrition, smoking, pollution, stress, and the circadian rhythm, have been associated with modification of epigenetic marks. Further examination of these mechanisms may lead to earlier prevention and novel therapy for CVD. \n  Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease. \n Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease. \n Gene expression regulation through the interplay of DNA methylation and histone modifications is well-established, although the knowledge about the function of epigenetic signatures in cardiovascular disease is still largely unexplored. \n The study of epigenetic markers is, therefore, a very promising frontier of science which may aid in a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of gene expression in the biomolecule pathways linked to cardiovascular diseases. \n Epigenetic alterations are associated with inflammation and cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. \n Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease \n Epigenetic mechanisms that underpin metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. \n Epigenetic regulation of cardiovascular differentiation. \n Epigenetic control mechanisms play a key role in the regulation of embryonic development and tissue homeostasis and modulate cardiovascular diseases. \n Are epigenetic modifications implicated in cardiovascular development and disease?",

        "question": "Modafinil improves antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism but not excessive daytime sleepiness, psychiatric symptoms or cognition in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. \n CONCLUSION: The data suggest that modafinil was a safe adjunctive treatment which improved parkinsonian symptoms and signs in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  \n A review of its effects in schizophrenia suggests that modafinil facilitates cognitive functions, with pro-mnemonic effects and problem solving improvements. Emotional processing also appears to be enhanced by the drug, although to date there are only a limited number of studies. \n BACKGROUND: Modafinil, a putative cognitive enhancing drug, has previously been shown to improve performance of healthy volunteers as well as patients with attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia, mainly in tests of executive functions.  \n A review of modafinil and armodafinil as add-on therapy in antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia. \n It has been suggested that modafinil and its isomer armodafinil as an add-on strategy to antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia may improve cognitive functioning, attenuate fatigue, inactiveness and other negative functions as well as weight gain. \n Evidence for the use of modafinil or armodafinil as add-on therapy to antipsychotic drugs to alleviate fatigue, sleepiness and inactivity is inconclusive. One cohort study and one out of two single-dose crossover RCTs in which modafinil addition was studied could demonstrate a positive effect. All five RCTs of modafinil (three RCTs) and armodafinil (two RCTs) addition with a longer study duration could not demonstrate a positive effect.  \n In RCTs with a treatment duration of 4 weeks or more, however, no positive effect could be demonstrated on cognitive functioning with modafinil and armodafinil addition. Yet, four single-dose crossover RCTs of modafinil addition show significant positive effects on executive functioning, verbal memory span, visual memory, working memory, spatial planning, slowing in latency, impulse control and recognition of faces expressing sadness and sadness misattribution in the context of disgust recognition. The addition of modafinil or armodafinil to an antipsychotic regime, despite theoretical and preclinical considerations, has not been proved to enhance cognitive function, attenuate fatigue, enhance activity, improve negative symptoms and reduce weight in patients with schizophrenia. \n RATIONAL: In recent years, evidence suggests that modafinil may be useful for certain symptom domains of schizophrenia, especially for the negative and cognitive symptoms.  \n CONCLUSION: The present study indicates modafinil as a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for treatment of schizophrenia particularly the negative symptoms.  \n Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug that has been shown to improve attention, memory and executive function in the healthy population and in patients with schizophrenia. \n CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot trial do not support routine use of modafinil to counteract increased weight and metabolic diseases in patients taking clozapine. \n Modafinil (2-((diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl)acetamide) is described as an atypical stimulant and is a putative cognition enhancer for schizophrenia, but the precise mechanisms of action remain unclear. \n Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug that has been shown to improve emotion discrimination in healthy individuals and attention and executive function in schizophrenia.  \n CONCLUSIONS: These data support clinical evidence that modafinil may alleviate cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and also demonstrate the benefit of applying PLSR modeling to characterize functional brain networks in translational models relevant to central nervous system dysfunction. \n Modafinil improves working memory in healthy subjects and individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, though the effects of modafinil have not been evaluated on working memory in methamphetamine-dependent subjects. \n Modafinil is a psychostimulant approved for treating excessive sleepiness in adults; off-label uses (e.g., treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, ADHD and age-related dementias) are currently being explored.  \n CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot trial do not support routine use of modafinil to treat negative symptoms, cognitive deficits, or wakefulness/fatigue in patients on clozapine. \n We have previously shown that the amount of movement exhibited by patients with schizophrenia is positively correlated with the volume of left anterior cingulate cortex and that this quantity of movement can be increased by modafinil.  \n OBJECTIVE: Given recent reports about the off-label use of modafinil as an adjuvant for the treatment of antipsychotic-associated sedation in schizophrenia patients and the recent interest in its putative cognitive-enhancing effects in this population, we present a systematic review of available data on trials of modafinil as an adjuvant in the treatment of cognitive deficits, negative symptoms, and antipsychotic-induced fatigue, and its tolerability.  \n RESULTS: One of 4 reviewed studies found a significant effect of modafinil as an alerting agent for antipsychotic-induced fatigue and sedation. Neither of 2 reviewed studies found modafinil to improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Three of 6 reviewed studies showed that modafinil may improve short-term memory, attention, and the ability to shift mental sets.  \n CONCLUSIONS: While the available data suggest that modafinil is generally well tolerated and may have some efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced sedation and cognitive domains, the small sample sizes, contradictory results, and methodological differences between trials, especially with respect to cognitive testing, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the overall effectiveness of modafinil as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia.  \n Hence, before prescribing modafinil to a schizophrenia patient, the possible risks and benefits of each particular case should be evaluated. \n Modafinil had a substantial placebo effect on outcomes such as fatigue, excessive sleepiness and depression in patients with traumatic brain injury, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, post-polio fatigue and multiple sclerosis; however, it did not provide any benefit greater than placebo. \n RATIONALE: The wake-promoting agent modafinil selectively improves neuropsychological task performance in healthy volunteers, in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and in schizophrenia.  \n Recently, however, modafinil has been shown to improve attentional set-shifting performance in patients with schizophrenia. \n In addition, modafinil shows initial promise for a variety of off-label indications in psychiatry, including treatment-resistant depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. \n There is increasing interest in the use of modafinil to improve cognition in schizophrenia as well as in other disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. \n Initial findings indicate that modafinil may lead to better executive functioning and attentional performance in patients with schizophrenia.  \n CONCLUSIONS: Although no effect on negative symptoms was found, adjunctive therapy with modafinil may result in global improvements in patients with schizophrenia who have prominent negative symptoms. \n CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil did not improve cognitive control in all schizophrenia patients. \n . These data suggest that modafinil increases quantifiable motor behaviour in schizophrenia and may have an impact on avolition. \n One patient was on treatment with both modafinil and trazodone and reported no change after tapering each in separate discontinuation trials, while another 3 patients were taking sleeping medications and also noted no change after discontinuation. \n  Neuroprotective agents as add-on therapies (e.g., modafinil, erythropoietin, glycine, D-serine, memantine and celecoxib) are currently being evaluated in schizophrenia and related disorders.  \n In the modafinil (N = 10) and placebo (N = 10) groups, fatigue improved significantly over time (p < .01), but there were no differences between groups on changes in fatigue, positive and negative symptoms, or cognition.  \n CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil modulates anterior cingulate cortex function in chronic schizophrenia but its beneficial cognitive effects may be restricted to a subset of patients requiring further characterisation. \n Modafinil significantly improved overall clinical condition, with 64% and 82% of patients rated as clinically improved at week 4 by a blinded clinician and the investigator respectively. \n Modafinil significantly improved fatigue (P = 0.025, week 3) and tended to improve cognitive functioning scores.  \n Although preliminary, these results suggest modafinil may be an effective and well-tolerated adjunct treatment that improves global functioning and clinical condition, and reduces fatigue in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  \n Modafinil had some cognitive enhancing properties in schizophrenia similar to those observed in healthy adults and adult patients with ADHD.  \n Modafinil may have potential as an important therapy for cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, particularly because of its beneficial effects on attentional set shifting. \n While the available data suggest that modafinil is generally well tolerated and may have some efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced sedation and cognitive domains, the small sample sizes, contradictory results, and methodological differences between trials, especially with respect to cognitive testing, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the overall effectiveness of modafinil as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia. \n Given recent reports about the off-label use of modafinil as an adjuvant for the treatment of antipsychotic-associated sedation in schizophrenia patients and the recent interest in its putative cognitive-enhancing effects in this population, we present a systematic review of available data on trials of modafinil as an adjuvant in the treatment of cognitive deficits, negative symptoms, and

        "question": "The activity of SERCA is regulated by two small, homologous membrane proteins called phospholamban (PLB, also known as PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Detailed structural information explaining this regulatory mechanism has been lacking, and the structural features defining the pathway through which cytoplasmic Ca(2+) enters the intramembranous binding sites of SERCA have remained unknown. \n Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase (SERCA) pump activity is modulated by phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Recent data suggest that SLN could play a role in muscle thermogenesis by promoting uncoupling of the SERCA pump \n Here we show that sarcolipin (Sln), a newly identified regulator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (Serca) pump, is necessary for muscle-based thermogenesis. \n Sarcolipin (SLN) is a 3 kD membrane protein found in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). It has 31 amino acid residues; SLN and phopholamban (PLB) are belong to the same protein family, so they have similar physiological functions. SLN inhibits sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) activity and reduces its affinity of Ca(2+), resulting in dysfunction of myocardial contraction and heart failure. \n Sarcolipin (SLN) is a key regulator of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and its expression is altered in diseased atrial myocardium. \n Together, these findings indicate that ablation of SLN results in increased SERCA activity and SR Ca(2+) load, which, in turn, could cause abnormal intracellular Ca(2+) handling and atrial remodeling. \n Sarcolipin (SLN) inhibits sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) pumps. \n These results show that 1) SLN regulates Ca(2+)-ATPase activity thereby regulating contractile kinetics in at least some skeletal muscles, 2) the functional significance of SLN is graded to the endogenous SLN expression level, and 3) SLN inhibitory effects on SERCA function are relieved in response to repeated contractions thus enhancing relaxation rates. \n The SERCA pump was constitutively activated in both atrial and ventricular chambers of the mouse heart by ablating its key regulators, phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). The double-knockout (dKO) mice for PLN and SLN showed increased SERCA pump activity, Ca(2+) transients and SR Ca(2+) load, and developed cardiac hypertrophy. \n Our findings also emphasize the need for dynamic regulation of the SERCA pump by PLN and/or SLN to maintain cardiac contractility in normal conditions and during pathophysiological states. \n Sarcolipin (SLN) has emerged as an important regulator of the atrial sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ transport. \n The inhibitory effect of SLN on cardiac SR Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump can be relieved by beta-adrenergic stimulation, which indicates that SLN is a reversible inhibitor.  \n Sarcolipin is a novel regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) and is expressed abundantly in atria. \n Our study documented that sarcolipin is a key regulator of SERCA2a in atria. Importantly, our data demonstrate the existence of distinct modulators for the SERCA pump in the atria and ventricles. \n Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) is a membrane protein that catalyzes the ATP-dependent transport of Ca(2+) from the cytosol to the SR. The activity of SERCA is inhibited by phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN), and all these proteins participate in maintaining the normal intracellular calcium handling.  \n Sarcolipin (SLN) is an integral membrane protein that is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, where it inhibits SERCA (calcium ATPase) by lowering its apparent Ca2+ affinity in a manner similar to that of its homologue phospholamban (PLN). \n Remarkably, each domain of SLN behaves in a manner similar to that of the corresponding domains in PLN, supporting the hypothesis that both SLN and PLN bind SERCA in the same groove and with similar mechanisms. \n The role of sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac physiology was critically evaluated by generating a transgenic (TG) mouse model in which the SLN to sarco(endoplasmic)reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) ratio was increased in the ventricle. Overexpression of SLN decreases SR calcium transport function and results in decreased calcium transient amplitude and rate of relaxation. SLN TG hearts exhibit a significant decrease in rates of contraction and relaxation when assessed by ex vivo work-performing heart preparations. \n We conclude that SLN is a novel regulator of SERCA pump activity, and its inhibitory effect can be reversed by beta-adrenergic agonists. \n Sarcolipin, a homologue of phospholamban, regulates Ca2+ uptake through the interaction with sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) and is predominantly expressed in the atrial muscle. \n Sarcolipin (SLN) and phospholamban (PLN) are effective inhibitors of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA).  \n These results show that NF-SLN expression impairs muscle contractile function by inhibiting SERCA function and diminishing sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores. \n Sarcolipin (SLN) is an inhibitor of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases (SERCAs) in vitro, but its function in vivo has not been defined. NF-SLN cDNA (SLN tagged N-terminally with a FLAG epitope) was introduced into rat soleus muscle in one hindlimb by plasmid injection and electrotransfer. \n Sarcolipin (SLN), a regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase of fast-twitch skeletal muscle (SERCA1a), is also expressed in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscles where phospholamban (PLN) and SERCA2a are expressed. \n Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) inhibition by sarcolipin is encoded in its luminal tail. \n The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). \n Sarcolipin (SLN) is an integral membrane protein that is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, where it inhibits SERCA (calcium ATPase) by lowering its apparent Ca2+ affinity in a manner similar to that of its homologue phospholamban (PLN). \n Phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) are two single-pass membrane proteins that regulate Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), an ATP-driven pump that translocates calcium ions into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, initiating muscle relaxation. \n Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) inhibition by sarcolipin is encoded in its luminal tail. \n Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase (SERCA) pump activity is modulated by phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac and skeletal muscle.

In spite of numerous mutagenesis and kinetic studies, we still do not have a clear mechanistic picture of how PLB influences the calcium transport cycle of SERCA. \n Calcium transport across the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays an important role in the regulation of heart muscle contraction and relaxation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) 2a is responsible for Ca(2+) up-take by this organelle and is inhibited in a reversible manner by phospholamban, another SR membrane protein. Thus, alleviation of phospholamban-mediated inhibition of SERCA2a is a potential therapeutic option for heart failure and cardiomyopathy. \n Phospholamban has been suggested to be a key regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca cycling and contractility and a potential therapeutic target in restoring the depressed Ca cycling in failing hearts. \n In larger mammals, a higher fraction of SERCA2a pumps are regulated by phospholamban, and this may influence therapeutic strategies to enhance cardiac contractility and functional cardiac reserve. \n Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and this inhibition is relieved by Ca(2+) calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) phosphorylation \n These findings suggest that PLB is an important modulator of gastric antrum smooth muscle contractility by modulation of SR Ca(2+) release and CaM kinase II activity. \n The function of the SERCA pump is modulated by the endogenous molecules phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN), expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. The mechanism of action of PLB on SERCA is well characterized, whereas that of SLN is only beginning to be understood.  \n  Phospholamban (PLB) is an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). \n These results show that alteration of the PLB:SERCA ratio can significantly modulate smooth muscle [Ca2+]i. \n Phospholamban expressed in cardiac muscle and sarcolipin expressed in skeletal muscle regulate SERCA activity. \n Phospholamban (PLB) is a 24- to 27-kDa phosphoprotein that modulates activity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA). Expression of PLB is reportedly limited to cardiac, slow-twitch skeletal and smooth muscle in which PLB is an important regulator of [Ca2+]i and contractility in these muscles. \n Regulation of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA 2a) depends on the phosphorylation state of phospholamban (PLB). When PLB is phosphorylated, its inhibitory effect towards SERCA 2a is relieved, leading to an enhanced myocardial performance.  \n  Ca(2+) reuptake occurs via sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and is regulated by the inhibitory protein phospholamban (PLB) in many cell types. \n Phospholamban (PLN) is a small integral membrane protein, which binds and inhibits in a yet unknown fashion the Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. \n Phospholamban (PLN) is the endogenous inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), the integral membrane enzyme responsible for 70\ufffd% of the removal of Ca(2+) from the cytosol, inducing cardiac muscle relaxation in humans. \n Phospholamban (PLN) is a type II membrane protein that inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), thereby regulating calcium homeostasis in cardiac muscle.

        "question": "In human hypertrophy, both CaMKII and PKA functionally regulate RyR2 and may induce SR Ca(2+) leak. In the transition from hypertrophy to HF, the diastolic Ca(2+) leak increases and disturbed Ca(2+) cycling occurs. This is associated with an increase in CaMKII- but not PKA-dependent RyR2 phosphorylation. CaMKII inhibition may thus reflect a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction. \n Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is an enzyme with important regulatory functions in the heart and brain, and its chronic activation can be pathological. CaMKII activation is seen in heart failure, and can directly induce pathological changes in ion channels, Ca(2+) handling and gene transcription. \n In the recent years, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was suggested to be associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure but also with arrhythmias both in animal models as well as in the human heart. \n Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has emerged as a central mediator of cardiac stress responses which may serve several critical roles in the regulation of cardiac rhythm, cardiac contractility and growth. Sustained and excessive activation of CaMKII during cardiac disease has, however, been linked to arrhythmias, and maladaptive cardiac remodeling, eventually leading to heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death.  \n Overexpression of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in transgenic mice results in heart failure and arrhythmias. \n From recent studies, it appears evident that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a central role in the arrhythmogenic processes in heart failure by sensing intracellular Ca(2+) and redox stress, affecting individual ion channels and thereby leading to electrical instability in the heart.  \n CaMKII activation is proarrhythmic in heart failure where myocardium is stretched. \n The Ca-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) seems to be involved in the development of heart failure and arrhythmias and may therefore be a promising target for the development of antiarrhythmic therapies. \n Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is up-regulated in heart failure and has been shown to cause I(Na) gating changes that mimic those induced by a point mutation in humans that is associated with combined long QT and Brugada syndromes. \n CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of Na(V)1.5 at multiple sites (including Thr-594 and Ser-516) appears to be required to evoke loss-of-function changes in gating that could contribute to acquired Brugada syndrome-like effects in heart failure. \n Because CaMKII expression and activity are increased in cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and during arrhythmias both in animal models as well as in the human heart a clinical significance of CaMKII is implied. \n The multifunctional Ca(2+)- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is now recognized to play a central role in pathological events in the cardiovascular system. CaMKII has diverse downstream targets that promote vascular disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias, so improved understanding of CaMKII signaling has the potential to lead to new therapies for cardiovascular disease. \n In our opinion, the multifunctional Ca and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has emerged as a molecule to watch, in part because a solid body of accumulated data essentially satisfy Koch's postulates, showing that the CaMKII pathway is a core mechanism for promoting myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure. Multiple groups have now confirmed the following: (1) that CaMKII activity is increased in hypertrophied and failing myocardium from animal models and patients; (2) CaMKII overexpression causes myocardial hypertrophy and HF and (3) CaMKII inhibition (by drugs, inhibitory peptides and gene deletion) improves myocardial hypertrophy and HF \n  In contrast, inhibiting the CaMKII pathway appears to reduce arrhythmias and improve myocardial responses to pathological stimuli.  \n In this review, we discuss the important role of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the regulation of RyR2-mediated Ca(2+) release. In particular, we examine how pathological activation of CaMKII can lead to an increased risk of sudden arrhythmic death. Finally, we discuss how reduction of CaMKII-mediated RyR2 hyperactivity might reduce the risk of arrhythmias and may serve as a rationale for future pharmacotherapeutic approaches. \n Transgenic (TG) Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) \u03b4(C) mice develop systolic heart failure (HF). CaMKII regulates intracellular Ca(2+) handling proteins as well as sarcolemmal Na(+) channels. We hypothesized that CaMKII also contributes to diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias via augmentation of the late Na(+) current (late I(Na)) in early HF (8-week-old TG mice). \n Thus, late I(Na) inhibition appears to be a promising option for diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias in HF where CaMKII is found to be increased. \n We tested the hypothesis that increased RyR2 phosphorylation by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is both necessary and sufficient to promote lethal ventricular arrhythmias. \n CONCLUSIONS: our results suggest that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylation of RyR2 Ca(2+) release channels at S2814 plays an important role in arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death in mice with heart failure. \n Excessive activation of calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) causes arrhythmias and heart failure, but the cellular mechanisms for CaMKII-targeted proteins causing disordered cell membrane excitability and myocardial dysfunction remain uncertain. \n Transgenic (TG) Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)delta(C) mice have heart failure and isoproterenol (ISO)-inducible arrhythmias. We hypothesized that CaMKII contributes to arrhythmias and underlying cellular events and that inhibition of CaMKII reduces cardiac arrhythmogenesis in vitro and in vivo. \n We conclude that CaMKII contributes to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in TG CaMKIIdelta(C) mice having heart failure and suggest the increased SR Ca leak as an important mechanism. Moreover, CaMKII inhibition reduces cardiac arrhythmias in vitro and in vivo and may therefore indicate a potential role for future antiarrhythmic therapies warranting further studies. \n Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) can phosphorylate RyR2 and modulate its activity. This phosphorylation positively modulates cardiac inotropic function but in extreme situations such as heart failure, elevated CaMKII activity can adversely increase Ca2+ release from the SR and lead to arrhythmogenesis.  \n Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase expressed abundantly in the heart. CaMKII targets numerous proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and excitability, and its activation may simultaneously contribute to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. \n Under stress conditions, excessive CaMKII activity promotes heart failure and arrhythmias, in part through actions at Ca(2+) homeostatic proteins. \n Ca-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was recently shown to alter Na(+) channel gating and recapitulate a human Na(+) channel genetic mutation that causes an unusual combined arrhythmogenic phenotype in patients: simultaneous long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome. CaMKII is upregulated in heart failure where arrhythmias are common, and CaMKII inhibition can reduce arrhythmias. Thus, CaMKII-dependent channel modulation may contribute to acquired arrhythmic disease.  \n In heart failure (HF), Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) expression is increased. Altered Na(+) channel gating is linked to and may promote ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) in HF. Calmodulin regulates Na(+) channel gating, in part perhaps via CaMKII. \n Thus, CaMKII-dependent regulation of Na(+) channel function may contribute to arrhythmogenesis in HF. \n Recent findings that CaMKII expression in the heart changes during hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardial ischemia, and infarction suggest that CaMKII may be a viable therapeutic target for patients suffering from common forms of heart disease. \n  Overexpression of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in transgenic mice results in heart failure and arrhythmias. \n Transgenic (TG) Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)delta(C) mice have heart failure and isoproterenol (ISO)-inducible arrhythmias. \n Overexpression of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in transgenic mice results in heart failure and arrhythmias. \n BACKGROUND: Transgenic (TG) Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)delta(C) mice have heart failure and isoproterenol (ISO)-inducible arrhythmias. \n The Ca-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) seems to be involved in the development of heart failure and arrhythmias and may therefore be a promising target for the development of antiarrhythmic therapies. \n CaMKII targets numerous proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and excitability, and its activation may simultaneously contribute to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. \n Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II contributes to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in heart failure. \n From recent studies, it appears evident that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a central role in the arrhythmogenic processes in heart failure by sensing intracellular Ca(2+) and redox stress, affecting individual ion channels and thereby leading to electrical instability in the heart. \n The Ca-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) seems to be involved in the development of heart failure and arrhythmias and may therefore be a promising target for the development of antiarrhythmic therapies. \n Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II contributes to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in heart failure. \n CaMKII targets numerous proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and excitability, and its activation may simultaneously contribute to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. \n Ryanodine receptor phosphorylation, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. \n Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II contributes to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in heart failure. \n CaMKII targets numerous proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and excitability, and its activation may simultaneously contribute to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias \n Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II contributes to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in heart failure. \n The Ca-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) seems to be involved in the development of heart failure and arrhythmias and may therefore be a promising target for the development of antiarrhythmic therapies \n Calcium-calmodulin kinase II mediates digitalis-induced arrhythmias. \n Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II contributes to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in heart failure. \n The Ca-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) seems to be involved in the development of heart failure and arrhythmias and may therefore be a promising target for the development of antiarrhythmic therapies \n The Ca-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) seems to be involved in the development of heart failure and arrhythmias and may therefore be a promising target for the development of antiarrhythmic therapies \n Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II contributes to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in heart failure. \n Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II contributes to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in heart failure. \n The Ca-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) seems to be involved in the development of heart failure and arrhythmias and may therefore be a promising target for the development of antiarrhythmic therapies \n CaMKII targets numerous proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and excitability, and its activation may simultaneously contribute to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias \n Transgenic (TG) Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)delta(C) mice have heart failure and isoproterenol (ISO)-inducible arrhythmias \n Is Calcium/Calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) involved in cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure?",

        "question": "The HRC effects on RyR may be regulated by the Ca(2+)-sensitivity of its interaction with triadin. \n In rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscles, HRC binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes via triadin, a junctional SR protein.  \n HRC may play a key role in the regulation of SR Ca cycling through its direct interactions with SERCA2 and triadin, mediating a fine cross talk between SR Ca uptake and release in the heart. \n Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is located in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that binds to both triadin (TRN) and SERCA affecting Ca(2+) cycling in the SR. \n HRC is a SR luminal Ca(2+) binding protein known to associate with both triadin and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, and may thus mediate the crosstalk between SR Ca(2+) uptake and release. \n The histidine-rich Ca(2+) binding protein (HRC) is a high capacity Ca(2+) binding protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Because HRC appears to interact directly with triadin, HRC may play a role in the regulation of Ca(2+) release during excitation-contraction coupling. \n In the present study, we have performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments and show that HRC binds directly to triadin, which is an integral membrane protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. \n A direct binding of HRC (histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding protein) to triadin, the main transmembrane protein of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle, seems well supported. \n The present study documents the binding interaction of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) transmembrane protein triadin with peripheral histidine-rich, Ca(2+)-binding protein (HCP). \n In addition, the intra-luminal histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) has been shown to interact with both SERCA2a and triadin. \n Notably, there is physical and direct interaction between these protein players, mediating a fine-cross talk between SR Ca-uptake, storage and release. \n The histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (HRCBP) is expressed in the junctional SR, the site of calcium release from the SR. HRCBP is expressed exclusively in muscle tissues and binds calcium with low affinity and high capacity. In addition, HRCBP interacts with triadin, a protein associated with the ryanodine receptor and thought to be involved in calcium release. Its calcium binding properties, localization to the SR, and interaction with triadin suggest that HRCBP is involved in calcium handling by the SR. \n Using a fusion protein binding assay, we further identified the histidine-rich acidic repeats of HRC as responsible for the binding of HRC to triadin.  \n The HRC binding domain of triadin was also localized by fusion protein binding assay to the lumenal region containing the KEKE motif that was previously shown to be involved in the binding of triadin to calsequestrin. Notably, the interaction of HRC and triadin is Ca(2+)-sensitive. Our data suggest that HRC may play a role in the regulation of Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by interaction with triadin. \n Further support for colocalization of HRC with triadin cytoplasmic domain is provided here by experiments of mild tryptic digestion of tightly sealed TC vesicles. \n We demonstrate that HRC can be isolated as a complex with triadin, following equilibrium sucrose-density centrifugation in the presence of mM Ca(2+). \n Here, we characterized the COOH-terminal portion of rabbit HRC, expressed and purified as a fusion protein (HRC(569-852)), with respect to Ca(2+)-binding properties, and to the interaction with triadin on blots, as a function of the concentration of Ca(2+). \n Our results identify the polyglutamic stretch near the COOH terminus, as the Ca(2+)-binding site responsible, both for the acceleration in mobility of HRC on SDS-PAGE in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Ca(2+), and for the enhancement by high Ca(2+) of the interaction between HRC and triadin cytoplasmic segment. \n In addition to providing further evidence that HCP coenriches with RyR1, FKBP-12, triadin and calsequestrin (CS) in sucrose-density-purified TC vesicles, using specific polyclonal antibody, we show it to be expressed as a single protein species, both in fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibers, and to identically localize to the I-band. \n Colocalization of HCP and triadin at junctional triads is supported by the overlapping staining pattern using monoclonal antibodies to triadin. We show a specific binding interaction between digoxigenin-HCP and triadin, using ligand blot techniques. \n Suggesting that triadin dually interacts with HCP and with CS, at distinct sites, we have found that triadin-CS interaction in overlays does not require the presence of Ca2+. \n These differential effects form the basis for the hypothesis that HCP anchors to the junctional membrane domain of the SR, through binding to triadin short cytoplasmic domain at the NH2 terminus. \n Although the function of this interaction, as such, is not well understood, it seems of potential biological interest within the more general context of the structural-functional role of triadin at the triadic junction in skeletal muscle. \n BACKGROUND: Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is located in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that binds to both triadin (TRN) and SERCA affecting Ca(2+) cycling in the SR. Chronic overexpression of HRC that may disrupt intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis is implicated in pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. \n Interaction of HRC (histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding protein) and triadin in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum. \n The histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) is an SR component that binds to triadin and may affect Ca release through the ryanodine receptor. \n A direct binding of HRC (histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding protein) to triadin, the main transmembrane protein of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle, seems well supported. \n The HRC effects on RyR may be regulated by the Ca(2+)-sensitivity of its interaction with triadin. \n The histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) is an SR component that binds to triadin and may affect Ca release through the ryanodine receptor \n Because HRC appears to interact directly with triadin, HRC may play a role in the regulation of Ca(2+) release during excitation-contraction coupling \n A direct binding of HRC (histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding protein) to triadin, the main transmembrane protein of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle, seems well supported \n A direct binding of HRC (histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding protein) to triadin, the main transmembrane protein of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle, seems well supported \n The histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) is an SR component that binds to triadin and may affect Ca release through the ryanodine receptor \n Interaction of HRC (histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding protein) and triadin in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum. \n Does the histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) interact with triadin?",

        "question": "Desmin-related myofibrillar myopathy (DRM) is a cardiac and skeletal muscle disease caused by mutations in the desmin (DES) gene. Mutations in the central 2B domain of DES cause skeletal muscle disease that typically precedes cardiac involvement. However, the prevalence of DES mutations in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) without skeletal muscle disease is not known. \n The lack of severe disruption of cytoskeletal desmin network formation seen with mutations in the 1A and tail domains suggests that dysfunction of seemingly intact desmin networks is sufficient to cause DCM. \n According to the predominant view, desmin mutations cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We evaluated a family with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) associated with a novel desmin mutation and reviewed recent reports regarding the frequency of RCM in patients with desmin myopathy. \n Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by enlargement and dilation of all heart compartments associated with serious decrease of its contractile function. DCM hallmark is the combination of dystrophic and hypertrophic alterations of cardiomyocytes. Since the power output of cardiac cells is directly related to remodeling of their contractile machinery we investigated expression of selected contractile and cytoskeletal proteins in the left ventricle of DCM patients using immunoblotting. The content of the recognized protein markers of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy such as tubulin, desmin and slow skeletal myosin heavy chain isoform, MHCbeta, was significantly elevated in DCM compared to normal myocardium. \n In contrast, overexpression of desmin filaments by itself is not detrimental to the heart. Although loss-of-function studies have been more limited, ablation of the desmin gene causes mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, resulting in cardiomyopathy in mice. From function studies, abnormal desmin aggregation and disruption of the desmin networks resulting from expression of either mutant desmin or mutant CryAB have been shown to remodel the heart and compromise cardiac function, suggesting their synergistic roles in disease pathogenesis. \n A missense mutation in the desmin gene (DES) causes DCM in a human family. \n Mice deficient in desmin, the muscle-specific member of the intermediate filament gene family, display defects in all muscle types and particularly in the myocardium. Desmin null hearts develop cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) characterized by extensive myocyte cell death, calcific fibrosis and multiple ultrastructural defects. Several lines of evidence suggest impaired vascular function in desmin null animals. \n Familial DCM is commonly inherited as autosomal dominant trait; less frequently it is autosomal recessive, X-linked or matrilinear. The disease is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Genes causally linked to this phenotype include dystrophin, dystrophin-associated glycoproteins, actin, desmin, beta-miosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin T, and mitochondrial DNA genes, mostly transfer RNAs. \n Examination of families has identified so far eight disease genes, namely the dystrophin, tafazzin, cardiac actin, desmin, lamin A/C, delta- sarcoglycan, cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain, and cardiac troponin T gene. \n Mutations of the desmin,   delta-sarcoglycan, the cardiac actin and beta-myosin heavy chain as well as the troponin T gene are known to cause autosomal dominant-dilated cardiomyopathy without other abnormalities. \n Autosomal dominant DCM is the most frequent form (56% of our cases), and several candidate disease loci have been identified by linkage analysis. Three disease genes are presently known: the cardiac actin gene, the desmin gene, and the lamin A/C gene. \n Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Two genes have been identified for the X-linked forms (dystrophin and tafazzin), whereas three other genes (actin, lamin A/C, and desmin) cause autosomal dominant DCM; \n Desmin defects were also recently identified in 1 familial dilated cardiomyopathy. \n By candidate gene screening, the molecular diagnosis can be provided for dystrophin, DAG, mitochondrial DNA, actin and desmin gene defects. \n Desmin (z-bands) are partly destroyed in DCM. Anti-desmin antibody titers as indicators of a possible secondary immune response are found high in patients with acute myocarditis declining during reconvalescence and are also elevated in DCM.  \n Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein, is a major target in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure in humans and mice \n Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament, is involved in myofibrillar myopathies, dilated cardiomyopathy and muscle wasting \n Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament, is involved in myofibrillar myopathies, dilated cardiomyopathy and muscle wasting \n Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament, is involved in myofibrillar myopathies, dilated cardiomyopathy and muscle wasting \n Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament, is involved in myofibrillar myopathies, dilated cardiomyopathy and muscle wasting \n Is desmin an intermediate filament protein involved in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)?",

        "question": "In contrast to K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains function in nonproteasomal biological processes. \n Modification of proteins by the addition of lysine (K)-63-linked polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains is suggested to play important roles in a variety of cellular events, including DNA repair, signal transduction, and receptor endocytosis.  \n Ubiquitination is best known for its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but evidence of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin is also rapidly accumulating. One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3, have recently been shown to have a positive role in the canonical pathway that activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), but a negative role in the noncanonical pathway that activates NF-kappaB through IKKalpha. These opposing roles of TRAF proteins may be linked to their ability to synthesize distinct forms of polyubiquitin chains. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. Thus, ubiquitin chains are dynamic switches that can influence signaling outputs in dramatically different ways. \n Importantly, although Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains appear to trigger proteasomal degradation, the presence of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains suggests that ubiquitination of IP(3)Rs may have physiological consequences beyond signaling for degradation. \n Chains of ubiquitin linked via lysine 48 (K48) are associated with protein degradation while chains linked via lysine 63 (K63) are associated with intracellular signaling. \n In contrast to K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains function in nonproteasomal biological processes. \n Modification of proteins by the addition of lysine (K)-63-linked polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains is suggested to play important roles in a variety of cellular events, including DNA repair, signal transduction, and receptor endocytosis.  \n Lys(48)-linked chains target proteins for proteasomal degradation, and Lys(63)-linked chains function in signal transduction, endocytosis and DNA repair \n Lys(48)-linked chains target proteins for proteasomal degradation, and Lys(63)-linked chains function in signal transduction, endocytosis and DNA repair \n Importantly, although Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains appear to trigger proteasomal degradation, the presence of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains suggests that ubiquitination of IP(3)Rs may have physiological consequences beyond signaling for degradation. \n Remarkably, the attached Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains are homogeneous and are segregated to separate IP(3)R subunits, and Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains, but not Lys-63-linked chains, are required for IP(3)R degradation \n Importantly, although Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains appear to trigger proteasomal degradation, the presence of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains suggests that ubiquitination of IP(3)Rs may have physiological consequences beyond signaling for degradation. \n Activated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are modified by homogeneous Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains, but only Lys-48-linked chains are required for degradation. \n Is K-63 linked protein ubiquitination related to proteasomal degradation?",

Taken together, these studies suggest that 50 mg is the minimum effective dose of desvenlafaxine for the treatment of major depressive disorder.  \n Desvenlafaxine XR was dosed at 50 mg/day for 10 days. \n Desvenlafaxine therapy is initiated at the therapeutic dose (50 mg/day) without a need for dose titration. \n Clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of DVS in doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg/day for the treatment of MDD in adult outpatients. The effects of DVS 50 mg/day have been clearly distinguished from placebo in the reduction of MDD symptoms in such clinical trials. No additional therapeutic benefits were found at doses > 50 mg/day.

A test dose is not required, and it can be used more widely across a spectrum of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia indication \n  Intravenous iron offers a rapid means of iron repletion and is superior to oral iron in many circumstances, especially in the presence of anemia of chronic disease, where it appears to overcome the block to absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract and immobilization of stored iron.

These include nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, obstetrics, menorrhagia, and anemia associated with cancer and its treatment.  \n Ferric carboxymaltose can be administered at 15 mg/kg body weight to a maximum dose of 1000 mg, whereas iron isomaltoside 1000 can be administered at 20 mg/kg body weight. The ability to give high doses of iron is important in the context of managing iron deficiency anemia in a number of clinical conditions where demands for iron are high (including chronic blood loss associated with inflammatory bowel disease, menorrhagia, and chronic kidney disease) \n erric carboxymaltose (FCM, Ferinject) was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in nine, Phase III, randomized, controlled, multicenter trials in a diverse range of indications, including patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), post-partum anemia (PPA) or abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), chronic heart failure (CHF), non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those undergoing hemodialysis (HD \n In patients with IBD or PPA, improvements in Hb levels were more rapid with FCM than with FeSulf.  \n CM improved patient quality of life to an equivalent extent to oral FeSulf in patients with IBD or PPA, and to a greater extent than oral FeSulf in women with AUB \n Four different products are principally used in clinical practice, which differ in their pharmacokinetic properties and safety profiles: iron gluconate and iron sucrose (lower single doses), and iron dextran and ferric carboxymaltose (higher single doses). \n he prevalence of anemia across studies on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is high (30%). \n  novel intravenous iron formulation for treatment of anemia in inflammatory bowel disease: the ferric carboxymaltose (FERINJECT) randomized controlled trial. \n FeCarb is effective and safe in IBD-associated anemia.

ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver. \n In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes. \n Here we report that cohesins colocalize with CTCF at two additional imprinted loci, the Dlk1-Dio3 and the Kcnq1/Kcnq1ot1 loci. \n By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cells \n Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci \n Here we show that zebrafish runx1 is directly bound by cohesin and CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) at the P1 and P2 promoters, and within the intron between P1 and P2. \n The intronic binding sites for cohesin and CTCF coincide with histone modifications that confer enhancer-like properties, and two of the cohesin/CTCF sites behaved as insulators in an in vivo assay \n The identified cohesin and CTCF binding sites are likely to be cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for runx1 since they also recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). \n We have found that CTCF and cohesin are highly enriched at the convergent and partially overlapping transcripts for the LMP1 and LMP2A genes, but it is not yet known how CTCF and cohesin may coordinately regulate these transcripts \n haracterization of constitutive CTCF/cohesin loci: a possible role in establishing topological domains in mammalian genomes \n Our analysis revealed: 1) constitutive CTCF loci were located in constitutive open chromatin and often co-localized with constitutive cohesin loci \n In brain, a third of CTCF and cohesin binding sites coincide, consistent with the potential for many interactions between cohesin and CTCF but also many instances of independent action \n Here, we focus on the emerging roles of CTCF and the cohesin in coordinating long-range interactions between regulatory elements \n Chromatin immunoprecipitation for CTCF and the cohesin subunits RAD21 and SMC3 reveals evolutionarily conserved binding sites within unmethylated regions \u223c5 kb downstream of the PLAGL1 differentially methylated region and within the PLAGL1 3' untranslated region (UTR) \n TCF physically links cohesin to chromatin \n ohesin and CTCF: cooperating to control chromosome conformation? \n Recently, three groups mapped numerous cohesin-binding sites in mammalian chromosomes and found substantial overlap with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) \n We found that each site contains a conserved CTCF consensus sequence, binds CTCF, and recruits the cohesin subunit Rad21 in vivo \n Recent experiments have revealed that cohesin binds to the same sites in mammalian genomes as the zinc finger transcription factor CTCF \n Here we review what is known about the roles of cohesin and CTCF in regulating gene expression in mammalian cells, and we discuss how cohesin might mediate the insulator function of CTCF \n Previous studies have shown that this major latency control region is occupied by the cellular chromatin boundary factor CTCF and chromosome structural maintenance proteins SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21, which comprise the cohesin complex \n Cohesin subunits assembled at the CTCF binding sites and bound CTCF proteins in a cell cycle-dependent manner \n We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survival \n We used chromosome conformation capture to determine long-range interactions among CTCF/cohesin sites over 2 Mb on human chromosome 11 encompassing the beta-globin locus and flanking olfactory receptor genes \n These results support a genome-wide role for CTCF/cohesin sites through loop formation that both influences transcription and contributes to cell-type-specific chromatin organization and function \n Increased methylation at this promoter triggered the dissociation of the insulator protein CTCF as well as the accompanying cohesin from the BDNF locus \n icotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-regulated DNA methylation alters CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/cohesin binding and transcription at the BDNF locus \n ecent studies have shown that the protein CTCF, which plays an important role in insulation and in large-scale organization of chromatin within the eukaryotic nucleus, depends for both activities on recruitment of the cohesin complex \n We show here that the interaction of CTCF with the cohesin complex involves direct contacts between the cohesin subunit SA2 and specific regions of the C-terminal tail of CTCF \n Taken together, our results demonstrate that specific sites on the C terminus of CTCF are essential for cohesin binding and insulator function \n The only direct interaction between CTCF and cohesin involves contact with SA2, which is external to the cohesin ring \n These numerous CTCF/cohesin sites potentially form the bases of the multiloop rosette structures at the Igh locus that compact during Ig heavy chain rearrangement \n We have previously shown that the Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) major latency transcripts encoding LANA, vCyclin, vFLIP, v-miRNAs, and Kaposin are regulated, in part, by a chromatin organizing element that binds CTCF and cohesins \n Mutation of the CTCF-cohesin binding site reduced or eliminated the chromatin conformation linkages, and deregulated viral transcription and genome copy number control \n Our findings indicate that KSHV genomes are organized into chromatin loops mediated by CTCF and cohesin interactions, and that these inter-chromosomal linkages coordinate latent and lytic gene control. \n We show here that GA disrupts an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex that accumulates at the CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron of the latency transcript. \n GA altered the enrichment of the RNAPII pausing complex, along with pausing factors SPT5 and NELF-A, at the intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites. \n GA treatment also inhibited the transcription of some cellular genes, like c-myc, which contain a similar CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron. \n These findings suggest that RNAPII pauses at intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites and that abrogation of this pausing by GA leads to loss of proper mRNA production and defects in sister chromatid cohesion, a process important for both viral and cellular chromosome stability. \n TCF and cohesin cooperatively mediate the cell-type specific interchromatin interaction between Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci \n Additional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF and cohesin. \n enome-wide studies of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin provide insight into chromatin structure and regulation \n Recent genome-wide studies mapping the binding sites of CTCF and its interacting partner, cohesin, using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealded that CTCF globally co-localizes with cohesin \n Here, we show by ChIP-Seq that most human subtelomeres contain a CTCF- and cohesin-binding site within \u223c1-2\u2009kb of the TTAGGG repeat tract and adjacent to a CpG-islands implicated in TERRA transcription control. \n These findings indicate that CTCF and cohesin are integral components of most human subtelomeres, and important for the regulation of TERRA transcription and telomere end protection \n In addition, we show that this DNA looping requires specific binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex to two symmetrically aligned binding sites in both the transcriptionally active promoters and in one of the enhancers \n Does the CTCF protein co-localize with

HAX-1 overexpression reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2) pump activity in isolated cardiomyocytes and in vivo, leading to depressed myocyte calcium kinetics and mechanics. \n Thus, HAX-1 represents a regulatory mechanism in cardiac calcium cycling and its responses to sympathetic stimulation, implicating its importance in calcium homeostasis and cell survival. \n Calcium ions are the most ubiquitous and versatile signaling molecules in eukaryotic cells. Calcium homeostasis and signaling systems are crucial for both the normal growth of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the intricate working of the mammalian heart. \n this knowledge can be used to help treat relevant human diseases such as pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure \n With aging, the heart develops myocyte hypertrophy associated with impaired relaxation indices. To define the cellular basis of this adaptation, we examined the physiological changes that arise in calcium handling in the aging heart and contrasted the adaptations that occur following the imposition of a stimulus that alters calcium homeostasis in a young and an old heart \n alterations in the calcium-handling machinery of the cardiocyte differ in the context of age and as such may predispose the older heart to the development of a hypertrophic phenotype. \n The cardiac sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX1) is a key sarcolemmal protein for the maintenance of calcium homeostasis in the heart.  \n Thus exchanger overexpression in mice leads to abnormal calcium handling and a decompensatory transition to heart failure with stress \n Central to controlling intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) are a number of Ca(2+) transporters and channels with the L-type Ca(2+) channel, Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) being of particular note in the heart. This review concentrates on the regulation of [Ca(2+)](i) in cardiac muscle and the homeostatic mechanisms employed to ensure that the heart can operate under steady-state conditions on a beat by beat basis. \n the tight regulation of SR Ca(2+) content is also required to prevent the abnormal, spontaneous or diastolic release of Ca(2+) from the SR. Such diastolic events are a major factor contributing to the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias in disease situations and in recently identified familial mutations in the SR Ca(2+) release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR). \n Calcium channels have a unique functional role, because not only do they participate in this activity, they form the means by which electrical signals are converted to responses within the cell. Calcium channels play an integral role in excitation in the heart and shaping the cardiac action potential. In addition, calcium influx through calcium channels is responsible for initiating contraction. Abnormalities in calcium homeostasis underlie cardiac arrhythmia, contractile dysfunction and cardiac remodelling.  \n Cardiac calcium (Ca(2+)) handling subsumes the mechanisms maintaining the myocardial Ca(2+) homeostasis that contribute essentially to cardiac performance. \n Calcium is an important mediator in cardiac excitation and disorders in cardiac Ca(2+) homeostasis have great influence on the cardiac action potential. \n We review the physiology of the cardiac calcium homeostasis, including the cardiac excitation contraction coupling and myocyte calcium cycling. \n Maintenance of cellular calcium homeostasis is critical to regulating mitochondrial ATP production and cardiac contraction.  \n We review the physiology of the cardiac calcium homeostasis, including the cardiac excitation contraction coupling and myocyte calcium cycling \n Calcium is an important mediator in cardiac excitation and disorders in cardiac Ca(2+) homeostasis have great influence on the cardiac action potential \n The role of calcium in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle physiology was reviewed, highlighting the major mechanisms responsible for maintaining calcium homeostasis in these cells \n We review the physiology of the cardiac calcium homeostasis, including the cardiac excitation contraction coupling and myocyte calcium cycling \n Energy metabolism and Ca(2+) handling serve critical roles in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology \n We review the physiology of the cardiac calcium homeostasis, including the cardiac excitation contraction coupling and myocyte calcium cycling \n Energy metabolism and Ca(2+) handling serve critical roles in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology \n Is Calcium homeostasis important in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology?",

        "question": "BACKGROUND: Progesterone has been associated with robust positive effects in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and with clinical benefits in two phase 2 randomized, controlled trials.  \n The proportion of patients with a favorable outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (good recovery or moderate disability) was 50.4% with progesterone, as compared with 50.5% with placebo. Mortality was similar in the two groups. No relevant safety differences were noted between progesterone and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Primary and secondary efficacy analyses showed no clinical benefit of progesterone in patients with severe TBI. These data stand in contrast to the robust preclinical data and results of early single-center trials that provided the impetus to initiate phase 3 trials. \n BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Progesterone has been shown to improve neurologic outcome in multiple experimental models and two early-phase trials involving patients with TBI.  \n There was no significant difference between the progesterone group and the placebo group in the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome (relative benefit of progesterone, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.06; P=0.35). Phlebitis or thrombophlebitis was more frequent in the progesterone group than in the placebo group (relative risk, 3.03; CI, 1.96 to 4.66).  \n CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial did not show a benefit of progesterone over placebo in the improvement of outcomes in patients with acute TBI.  \n Numerous studies, however, show that progesterone has substantial pleiotropic properties as a neuroprotective agent in both animal models and humans. \n RESULTS: There was a better recovery rate and GOS score for the patients who were given progesterone than for those in the control group in a 3-months follow-up period (50% vs. 21%); subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in the percentage of favorable outcome between the two groups with GCS of 5-8 (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The use of progesterone may significantly improve neurologic outcome of patients suffering severe TBI up to 3 months after injury, especially those with 5\u2264GCS\u22648, providing a potential benefit to the treatment of acute severe TBI patients. Considering this drug had no significant side effects, so progesterone could be used in patients with severe TBI as a neuro-protective drug. \n While progesterone and ciclosporin have shown promise in phase II studies, success in larger phase III, randomized, multicentre, clinical trials is pending. \n  All three studies reported the effects of progesterone on mortality. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for mortality at end of follow-up was 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.93. Three studies measured disability and found the RR of death or severe disability in patients treated with progesterone to be 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96. \n AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical evidence from three small RCTs indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering TBI. This evidence is still insufficient and further multicentre randomised controlled trials are required. \n GOS was classified to 2 main categories of favorable and unfavorable recovery, of which, favorable recovery in placebo, progesterone, and progesterone-vitamin D was 25%, 45%, and 60%, respectively which showed a statistical significant difference among the groups (P-value = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The results showed that recovery rate in patients with severe brain trauma in the group receiving progesterone and vitamin D together was significantly higher than that of progesterone group, which was in turn higher than that of placebo group. \n  The pooled relative risk (RR) for mortality at end of follow-up is 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.93. Three studies measured disability and found the RR of death or severe disability in patients treated with progesterone was 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.96. \n AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical evidence from three small RCTs indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering TBI. This evidence is still insufficient and further multicentre randomised controlled trials are required. \n Clinical trials have shown that short-and long-term progesterone treatment induces a significant improvement in the level of disability among patients with brain injury.  \n Improved outcomes from the administration of progesterone for patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial. \n CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that acute severe TBI patients with administration of progesterone hold improved neurologic outcomes for up to 6 months. These results provide information important for further large and multicenter clinical trials on progesterone as a promising neuroprotective drug.  \n The modified Functional Independence Measure scores in the progesterone group were higher than those in the placebo group at both 3-month and 6-month follow-up (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). The mortality rate of the progesterone group was significantly lower than that of the placebo group at 6-month follow-up (P < 0.05).  \n CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that acute severe TBI patients with administration of progesterone hold improved neurologic outcomes for up to 6 months. These results provide information important for further large and multicenter clinical trials on progesterone as a promising neuroprotective drug.  \n These data, combined with the results of the previously published ProTECT trial, show progesterone to be safe and potentially efficacious in the treatment of TBI. Larger phase III trials will be necessary to verify results prior to clinical implementation. \n CONCLUSION: It indicated that successive early application of PG will benefit the patients with acute severe head injury by improving the recovery and reducing the disability, which may be related to its alleviating inflammatory and lipid peroxidation response. \n Adverse and serious adverse event rates were similar in both groups, except that patients randomized to progesterone had a lower 30-day mortality rate than controls (rate ratio 0.43; 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.99).  \n However, moderate traumatic brain injury survivors who received progesterone were more likely to have a moderate to good outcome than those randomized to placebo. CONCLUSION: In this small study, progesterone caused no discernible harm and showed possible signs of benefit. \n After more than 30 years of research and 30 failed clinical trials with as many different treatments, progesterone is the first agent to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy as a treatment for traumatic brain injuries. \n BACKGROUND: Progesterone has been associated with robust positive effects in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and with clinical benefits in two phase 2 randomized, controlled trials.  \n The proportion of patients with a favorable outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (good recovery or moderate disability) was 50.4% with progesterone, as compared with 50.5% with placebo.

The results for interleukin-6 were similar to other studies.  \n -6 and IL-10 levels were higher in patients with poor outcome. On logistic regression analysis, higher values of IL-6 were significantly associated with clinical outcome at 1 month (odds ratio [OR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.54).  \n In hemorrhagic stroke, high levels of IL-6 in the early phase indicated a poor neurological outcome. \n Initially elevated levels of hs-IL-6 at presentation further correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes (by NIHSS and mRs) at both time points. Analysis of variance in the different quartiles identified an hs-IL-6 gradient-dependent correlation at both time points, such that the higher the initial hs-IL-6 concentration, the higher the elevation in inflammatory biomarkers and the poorer the neurological state at both time points (p<0.001 for NIHSS and p=0.001 for mRs, for trend across quartiles).

In February 2008, the SAINT II study was published, indicating that NXY-059 was not effective for AIS treatment. \n CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 is ineffective for treatment of AIS within 6 hours of symptom onset.  \n BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The SAINT I trial that showed a significant benefit of the neuroprotectant NXY-059 used a novel outcome for acute ischemic stroke trials: a shift toward good functional outcome on the 7-category modified Rankin scale (mRS). \n BACKGROUND: The free-radical-trapping agent NXY-059 showed promise as a neuroprotectant in the Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment I (SAINT I) trial, reducing disability when given to patients who had acute ischemic stroke.  \n CONCLUSIONS: NXY-059 is ineffective for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke within 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. \n The continued failure in approving new drugs for treatment of acute stroke has been recently set back by the failure of the NXY-059 (Stroke-Acute Ischemic NXY Treatment (SAINT) II) trial. \n The SAINT II Trial, a large randomized multicenter clinical trial of the putative neuroprotectant, NXY-059, failed to demonstrate a treatment benefit in acute ischemic stroke.  \n The positive results from the first Stroke-Acute-Ischaemic-NXY-Treatment (SAINT-I) trial of the free-radical spin-trap drug, NXY-059, which followed many of the STAIR guidelines, reinvigorated enthusiasm in neuroprotection, but the SAINT-II trial did not replicate the positive effect on the same primary prespecified outcome measure.  \n NXY-059, a free radical spin trap agent, was felt by many to have followed these criteria and it was recently shown to improve outcome in AIS patients in the SAINT I trial. However, the repeat, SAINT II trial was a neutral study, the results of which cast doubt on neuroprotection as a viable strategy for AIS.  \n NXY-059 is a novel free radical-trapping neuroprotectant that reduces infarct size and preserves brain function in animal models of acute ischemic stroke.

It has shown promising results and provides a silver lining for glioblastoma patients. \n For patient with and without Gliadel, median and 1-year RFS were 12.9 months and 52% vs. 14 months and 42%, respectively (p = 0.89). \n According to pathology, Gliadel did not influence OS of patients with Grade III or glioblastoma \n CONCLUSION: In patients with high-grade gliomas, adding Gliadel before performing a Stupp protocol did not improve survival. \n Randomized phase III trials have shown significant improvement of survival 1, 2, and 3 years after implantation of 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers for patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma.  \n CONCLUSIONS: The combination of aggressive resection, Gliadel wafer implantation, and GKS in addition to standard fractionated RT in selected patients resulted in increased local control and increased survival compared with a historical control group treated with surgery and involved-field RT alone. \n OBJECT: Gliadel (BCNU) wafer and concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) therapy, when used individually as adjuvant therapies, extend survival from that achieved by resection and radiation therapy (XRT) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).  \n BACKGROUND: Gliadel (polifeprosan 20 with carmustine [BCNU] implant) is commonly used for local delivery of BCNU to high-grade gliomas after resection and is associated with increased survival. \n Temozolomide administered according to this protocol produced a median survival benefit of 2 months in glioblastomas, and carmustine a similar benefit in high-grade gliomas. \n Analysis of a large trial by Westphal and colleagues (n = 240) showed a 29% risk reduction (P = 0.03) in the BCNU wafer-treated group over the course of the 30-month trial. \n Median survival of patients treated with BCNU wafers was 13.8 months vs 11.6 months in placebo-treated patients (P = 0.017) with a hazard ratio of 0.73 (P = 0.018), representing a 27% significant risk reduction. This survival advantage was maintained at 1, 2, and 3 years and was statistically significant (P = 0.01) at 3 years. \n CONCLUSION: Malignant glioma patients treated with BCNU wafers at the time of initial surgery in combination with radiation therapy demonstrated a survival advantage at 2 and 3 years follow-up compared with placebo. \n OBJECTIVE: Recently a randomized placebo-controlled phase III trial of biodegradable polymers containing carmustine has demonstrated a significant survival benefit for patients treated with local chemotherapy.  \n CONCLUSION: In this subgroup analysis of a phase III trial population both the clinical progression and radiological progression were significantly delayed in patients treated with local chemotherapy, resulting in an increased survival time. \n A previous placebo-controlled trial has shown that biodegradable 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers (Gliadel wafers) prolong survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. A previously completed phase 3 trial, also placebo controlled, in 32 patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma also demonstrated a survival benefit in those patients treated with BCNU wafers. \n Median survival in the intent-to-treat group was 13.9 months for the BCNU wafer-treated group and 11.6 months for the placebo-treated group (log-rank P -value stratified by country = 0.03), with a 29% reduction in the risk of death in the treatment group. When adjusted for factors affecting survival, the treatment effect remained positive with a risk reduction of 28% ( P = 0.03).  \n Controlled release delivery of carmustine from biodegradable polymer wafers was approved as an adjunct to surgical resection in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme after it was shown in clinical trials to be well tolerated and effective.  \n Clinical trials have demonstrated significant improvements in survival and quality of life for patients after complete tumour resection and BCNU wafer implantation. \n BCNU wafers are an effective means of increasing survival and quality of life in patients diagnosed with malignant glioma, and are a valuable addition to the overall multimodal treatment strategy for these tumours. \n CONCLUSIONS: Carmustine wafer with concurrent TMZ and radiation followed by rotational chemotherapy is a well tolerated, effective therapy, and has a survival benefit compared with radiation alone. \n Median overall survival in 14 studies of newly-diagnosed patients suggested a modest improvement versus resection followed by Stupp protocol or resection with BCNU wafers, with an acceptable and manageable safety profile. \n The efficacy of carmustine wafers for older patients with glioblastoma multiforme: prolonging survival. \n DISCUSSION: Older patients with GBM may benefit from carmustine wafers. The survival for older patients who received carmustine wafers is significantly longer than matched patients who did not receive carmustine wafers. \n For glioblastoma patients who received \u226590% resection in the BCNU wafer study, median survival increased for BCNU wafer versus placebo (14.5 versus 12.4\u00a0months, respectively; P\u2009=\u20090.02), but no survival increase was found for <90% resection (11.7 versus 10.6\u00a0months, respectively; P\u2009=\u20090.98). \n A wafer impregnated with carmustine, for use as an implant after surgical removal of recurrent GBM showed a prolongation in the median survival time of only 2 mo, from 20 to 28 wk in a study with a total of 222 patients.  \n No clear survival benefit associated with wafer implantation was identified. \n In three of the trials, patients with GBM who received carmustine wafers had significantly longer median survival than patients who did not receive wafers.  \n TMZ and carmustine (BCNU) biodegradable wafer (Gliadel) are the only adjuvant chemotherapies that have improved survival in randomised GB clinical trials .  \n The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events.  \n For patients undergoing repeat resection for malignant glioma, a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated a median survival for 110 patients who received carmustine polymers of 31 weeks compared with 23 weeks for 122 patients who only received placebo polymers. \n Median survival was improved from 11.6 to 13.9 months (P = 0.03), with a 29% reduction in the risk of death. When patients with glioblastoma multiforme alone were analyzed, the median survival improved from 11.4 to 13.5 months, but this improvement was not statistically significant.  \n OBJECT: Locoregional chemotherapy with carmustine wafers, positioned at surgery and followed by radiation therapy, has been shown to prolong survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, as has concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide. \n The efficacy of carmustine wafers for older patients with glioblastoma multiforme: prolonging survival. \n Following the resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas, local implantation of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (Gliadel) in the resection cavity constitutes an adjuvant therapy that can improve the possibilities of survival. \n The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events. \n However, patients with carmustine wafers demonstrated prolonged survival as compared to patients without wafers. \n The median survival for patients with carmustine wafers was 8.7 months, while median survival for patients without wafers was 5.5 months (P=0.007). \n Likewise, in subgroup analysis, patients older than 70 years (P=0.0003) and 75 years (P=0.04) who had carmustine wafers had significantly longer survival than matched patients without wafers. \n DISCUSSION: Carmustine wafers for primary HGG surgery in accordance with the NICE TA121 were associated with a median survival of 15.3 months; this is improved compared with previously reported randomised trials. Multimodal treatment with carmustine wafers, radical radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide was associated with improved survival. \n Implantation of carmustine wafers did not significantly improve progression-free survival \n In three of the trials, patients with GBM who received carmustine wafers had significantly longer median survival than patients who did not receive wafers \n A previous placebo-controlled trial has shown that biodegradable 1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers (Gliadel wafers) prolong survival in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme \n A previously completed phase 3 trial, also placebo controlled, in 32 patients with newly diagnosed malignant glioma also demonstrated a survival benefit in those patients treated with BCNU wafers \n Following the resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas, local implantation of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (Gliadel) in the resection cavity constitutes an adjuvant therapy that can improve the possibilities of survival \n Multimodal treatment with carmustine wafers, radical radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide was associated with improved survival \n The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events \n TMZ and carmustine (BCNU) biodegradable wafer (Gliadel) are the only adjuvant chemotherapies that have improved survival in randomised GB clinical trials  \n Following the resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas, local implantation of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (Gliadel) in the resection cavity constitutes an adjuvant therapy that can improve the possibilities of survival \n Multimodal treatment with carmustine wafers, radical radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide was associated with improved survival \n The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events \n TMZ and carmustine (BCNU) biodegradable wafer (Gliadel) are the only adjuvant chemotherapies that have improved survival in randomised GB clinical trials  \n Following the resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas, local implantation of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (Gliadel) in the resection cavity constitutes an adjuvant therapy that can improve the possibilities of survival \n Multimodal treatment with carmustine wafers, radical radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide was associated with improved survival \n The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events \n TMZ and carmustine (BCNU) biodegradable wafer (Gliadel) are the only adjuvant chemotherapies that have improved survival in randomised GB clinical trials  \n Following the resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastomas, local implantation of carmustine-impregnated biodegradable wafers (Gliadel) in the resection cavity constitutes an adjuvant therapy that can improve the possibilities of survival \n Multimodal treatment with carmustine wafers, radical radiotherapy and concomitant temozolomide was associated with improved survival \n The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events \n TMZ and carmustine (BCNU) biodegradable wafer (Gliadel) are the only adjuvant chemotherapies that have improved survival in randomised GB clinical trials  \n Do carmustine wafers improve survival of glioblastoma patients?",

        "question": "Physical activity, educational interventions, and cognitive-behavioral therapy have the most supportive data and can be recommended to patients with confidence.  \n For women undergoing radiotherapy (3 RCTs), hypnosis combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy improved distress and fatigue. \n Patients in the CBT group reported a significantly larger decrease in fatigue scores than patients in the waiting list group. \n However, relative to VCBT-I, PCBT-I was associated with significantly greater improvements of insomnia severity, early morning awakenings, depression, fatigue, and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep.  \n CBT-I may also improve mood, fatigue, and overall quality of life, and can be successfully delivered through a variety of treatment modalities, making it possible to reach a broader range of patients who may not have access to more traditional programs.  \n No group differences in improvement were noted relative to QOL, fatigue, or mood.  \n In case of persistent fatigue, personalized cognitive behavioral therapy can be considered. \n ONCLUSION: The results support CBTH as an evidence-based intervention to control fatigue in patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer.  \n Severe fatigue after cancer treatment can be treated effectively with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but it is unclear whether CBT has an effect on cognitive functioning. \n CONCLUSION: CBT for post-cancer fatigue has already been shown to be an effective therapy.  \n Frequently reported side effects include cancer-related fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and psychological distress. Exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy interventions have counteracted such adverse effects in other cancer populations.  \n There is evidence from methodologically rigorous controlled trials that exercise, psycho-educational interventions, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia are effective in the treatment of CRF, and a wide range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions has shown initial promise in single-arm pilot studies with small, heterogeneous samples.  \n CONCLUSIONS: Physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy and physical training alone had significant and beneficial effects on fatigue compared with no intervention. Physical training was equally effective as or more effective than physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing cancer-related fatigue, suggesting that cognitive-behavioral therapy did not have additional beneficial effects beyond the benefits of physical training. \n RESULTS: Imagery/hypnosis and CBT/CST interventions have produced improvement in all the three cancer-related symptoms individually: pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. \n RESULTS: Multilevel modeling indicated that for weekly FACIT fatigue data, there was a significant effect of the CBTH intervention on the rate of change in fatigue (p < .05), such that on average, CBTH participants' fatigue did not increase over the course of treatment, whereas control group participants' fatigue increased linearly. \n ONCLUSION: The results suggest that CBTH is an effective means for controlling and potentially preventing fatigue in breast cancer radiotherapy patients. \n Results were consistent with the view that CBTH was effective in managing fatigue and skin discomfort, and increasing relaxation. \n RESULTS: Participants in the Internet group showed significant improvements at post-assessment compared with those in the control group in overall insomnia severity (F(1,26) = 22.8; p<0.001), sleep efficiency (F(1,24) = 11.45; P = 0.002), sleep onset latency (F(1,24) = 5.18; P = 0.03), soundness of sleep (F(1,24) = 9.34; P = 0.005), restored feeling upon awakening (F(1,24) = 11.95; P = 0.002), and general fatigue (F(1,26) = 13.88; P = 0.001).  \n Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) has alleviated fatigue and improved QOL of cancer patients; however, little is known about the effects of nurse-led CBT on breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. \n Physical training was equally effective as or more effective than physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing cancer-related fatigue, suggesting that cognitive-behavioral therapy did not have additional beneficial effects beyond the benefits of physical training. \n For women undergoing radiotherapy (3 RCTs), hypnosis combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy improved distress and fatigue. \n Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) has alleviated fatigue and improved QOL of cancer patients; however, little is known about the effects of nurse-led CBT on breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. \n Physical training was equally effective as or more effective than physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing cancer-related fatigue, suggesting that cognitive-behavioral therapy did not have additional beneficial effects beyond the benefits of physical training. \n Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) has alleviated fatigue and improved QOL of cancer patients; however, little is known about the effects of nurse-led CBT on breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. \n Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) has alleviated fatigue and improved QOL of cancer patients; however, little is known about the effects of nurse-led CBT on breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. \n The positive effects of cognitive behavioral therapy in adolescents with chronic fatigue syndrome are sustained after cognitive behavioral therapy \n Physical training was equally effective as or more effective than physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing cancer-related fatigue, suggesting that cognitive-behavioral therapy did not have additional beneficial effects beyond the benefits of physical training. \n Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) has alleviated fatigue and improved QOL of cancer patients; however, little is known about the effects of nurse-led CBT on breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. \n Can cognitive behavioral therapy improve fatigue in cancer patients?",

        "question": "These central nervous system (CNS)-mediated effects provide the rationale for use of TRH and its analogs in the treatment of brain and spinal injury, and CNS disorders like schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, depression, shock and ischemia. \n The Effect of TRH to correct the abnormal F responses in SSP might be consistent with effects of TRH to reduce spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis described previously \n Agents undergoing therapeutic trials at present include CNTF, IGF1 glutamate antagonists, branched-chain amino acids and TRH analogue. \n Evidence that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has prominent trophic effects on the motor system led to several negative therapeutic trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease of the motor system. \n The results of the clinical evaluation at the beginning and end of the treatment as well as after patient follow up demonstrated that beneficial effects do not occur equally in all patients but rather are transitory and do not improve the natural evolution of the disease. \n The neurological evaluation after acute TRH-T treatment showed an objective improvement in 3 of the 8. \n The outcome of the study, in agreement with some and at variance with other studies, was that TRH induced a statistically significant neurological improvement in 17 of the 23 ALS patients but little or none in the other ALS patients and in patients with other neurological diseases. \n [A case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with disturbance of vertical ocular movement responding to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH)]. \n TRH injections resulted in improvement of disturbance of vertical ocular movement, but no effect was seen on the weakness of the limb. \n 13 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were treated with intravenous infusion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).  \n Similar improvements in speech, swallowing and in tongue and jaw movements were seen after iv and oral administration in nine, five and eight patients respectively.  \n No clinical improvement was detected.  \n A trial of Thyrotropin Releasing Hormone (TRH) 5.0 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously every other day for two weeks produced transient increased tone in muscles, along with other (side-) effects in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). \n Although the mechanism is not known, several reports of the effectiveness of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) in ALS were recently published. \n Protirelin (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) appears to be a neuromodulator in the extrahypothalamic nervous system and has been suggested as an adjunct in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  \n Clinical studies have shown that response to TRH is state dependent, that is, it depends on whether the patient has bulbar or nonbulbar signs and is male or female. Future studies must take into consideration this state dependence as a specific feature of the pharmacological action of TRH and its analogues. \n Three of the studies showed a transient, statistically significant effect in at least some muscles. The two studies that demonstrated no such effect both used TRH in very small doses. It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that the effect of TRH in ALS is a definite, acute, and transient response.  \n It was found that in only 3 out of 14 patients with moderately progressed disease no improvement was achieved, while in 11 cases the improvement was from 10 to 20%. However, the improvement was transient, and TRH treatment failed to stop the progression of the disease. \n Only 3 patients noted subjective improvement of strength. \n In 6 of the 9, TRH induced a significant increase in vibratory inhibition. This suggests that the TRH-induced reduction of spasticity might be due to an increase in presynaptic inhibition acting on Ia fibres. \n However, 2 mg DN-1417, IM twice a day for 1 month in an open-label trial, produced no objective improvement of strength in nine patients with ALS.  \n Our experience suggests that this approach is safe, has high patient acceptance, and is worthy of more careful evaluation. \n Focal, small-to-moderate and transient improvement occurred in the muscle strength and function of patients with ALS who received TRH in dose-response and screening studies. In a small pilot study of 12 patients, 3 months administration of TRH at 10 mg per kg on alternate days resulted in localized increased strength of jaw muscles as well as significant improvement in lower extremity function. Aerobic exercise capacity was particularly improved in patients with ALS following administration of TRH.  \n Mild to moderate improvement was found in 9 (56%) of 16 patients.  \n We thought such action of TRH to be useful to the therapy of ALS. \n With daily TRH, 10 patients noted subjective improvement without objective evidence, and 10 patients complained of worsening of the disease with objective decline after TRH was stopped. Statistical analysis, however, showed no beneficial effects from either acute or chronic TRH trials. \n A temporary increase in the strength of some muscles was detected following the administration of TRH, but no change in functional performance was noted. Neither the patients nor the investigators believed the effects were of any marked clinical significance. \n Nevertheless, statistically significant improvement was seen only in dynametric strength 1 hour after subcutaneous injection (p less than 0.05). Significant improvement occurred, in one patient only, on subjective speech testing during IV infusion of TRH. In none of six other ratings was there a significant difference between TRH and placebo. Subjective improvement was noted by 11 of 12 patients. \n Significant improvement, as shown by statistical analysis, was noted in muscle strength in the 9 patients by 5 infusions over a 4-week period and a sub-group of 5 patients treated by 8 infusions over 10 weeks. \n The progressive course of this disease, manifested by increasing atrophy, paralysis and disability score, was not altered.  \n Very high intravenous doses (2-19 mg/min) of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH, L-pyroglutamyl-L-histidyl-L-prolinamide) given to 12 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) produced a moderate to marked improvement of functions caused by deficiency of lower motor neurons (weakness) and upper motor neurons (spasticity). The improvement was sustained throughout the infusion and for about 1 h thereafter; sometimes a slight improvement was evident 20 h after infusion. \n These central nervous system (CNS)-mediated effects provide the rationale for use of TRH and its analogs in the treatment of brain and spinal injury, and CNS disorders like schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, depression, shock and ischemia. \n The Effect of TRH to correct the abnormal F responses in SSP might be consistent with effects of TRH to reduce spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis described previously \n Aerobic exercise capacity was particularly improved in patients with ALS following administration of TRH \n Aerobic exercise capacity was particularly improved in patients with ALS following administration of TRH \n Aerobic exercise capacity was particularly improved in patients with ALS following administration of TRH \n Is there any data to suggest that TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) administration can improve symptom severity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients?",

Endoscopic examination of the larynx revealed insufficient abduction of the bilateral vocal cords, although the glottis was not so small as to cause stridor during inspiration.  \n The stridor was specific to MSA.  \n Patients with MSA can present other clinical features, such as inspiratory stridor and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). We report a patient with pathologically confirmed MSA who presented with a longstanding history of stridor, RBD and autonomic disturbances but did not develop overt parkinsonism or cerebellar signs. This case illustrates that MSA may present clinically without its cardinal motor symptoms, and that stridor and RBD may be clues to recognise the disease in a patient with autonomic failure. \n Patients with PD did not display sleep hypoventilation, stridor and abnormal central sleep apnea.  \n DEVELOPMENT: Autonomic disorders such as seborrhoeic dermatitis and disorders involving sweating, fatigue, weight loss or respiratory problems (dyspnea, inspiratory stridor) are highly prevalent and very disabling symptoms. In addition, they may be the main problem in a particular phase of PD (fatigue, stridor) and condition the quality of life of patients with Parkinson.  \n .

Except for sleep fragmentation, the incidence of these disorders was significantly higher than in PD \n Six days after admission, dyspnea and inspiratory stridor were noted, and the respiratory distress worsened.  \n A patient is described with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and severe laryngeal stridor. \n The laryngeal stridor responded to levodopa therapy, and we are not aware that this has been reported previously. \n The subsequent clinical course of the former eight patients has been typical of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, whilst the ninth patient has developed postural hypotension, urinary incontinence and respiratory stridor typical of multiple system atrophy.  \n Although each of five autonomic domains was affected in variable numbers of IPD patients, AD in MSA generally involved more autonomic domains than in IPD, and to a more severe degree, in particular with regard to inspiratory stridor. \n However, the presence of severe AD, of AD preceding parkinsonism, or of inspiratory stridor, are all individually suggestive of MSA. \n Apart from dysautonomia, the principal discriminant clinical features that distinguished SND from PD were the early appearance of the following symptoms and signs: (a) severe and atypical progressive parkinsonism characterized by bilateral bradykinesia and rigidity, slowness of gait, postural instability, and falls, and poor or absent response to adequate levodopa treatment; (b) increased tendon reflexes associated or not with frank pyramidal signs, severe dysarthria, and less consistently, dysphagia, stridor, antecollis, and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, which, when present, are highly suggestive of the disease. \n OBJECTIVES: (1) To present a rare case of stridor secondary to prolonged laryngospasm in a patient with Parkinson's disease, and (2) to review the literature on stridor in Parkinson's disease. METHODS: We report a 73-year-old Parkinson's disease patient who developed acute stridor due to prolonged laryngospasm triggered by overspill of excessive secretions.  \n RESULT: Only 12 previously reported cases of stridor in Parkinson's disease patients were identified.  \n This case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in Parkinson's disease patients, as this affects management. \n RESULT: Only 12 previously reported cases of stridor in Parkinsons disease patients were identified. \n This case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in Parkinsons disease patients, as this affects management. \n OBJECTIVES: (1) To present a rare case of stridor secondary to prolonged laryngospasm in a patient with Parkinsons disease, and (2) to review the literature on stridor in Parkinsons disease. \n METHODS: We report a 73-year-old Parkinsons disease patient who developed acute stridor due to prolonged laryngospasm triggered by overspill of excessive secretions. \n The authors describe a patient experiencing stridor and dysphagia with confirmed pulmonary restriction and aspiration following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulator adjustment, with a resolution of symptoms and signs when the stimulator was switched off. \n The authors describe a patient experiencing stridor and dysphagia with confirmed pulmonary restriction and aspiration following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulator adjustment, with a resolution of symptoms and signs when the stimulator was switched off. \n (1) To present a rare case of stridor secondary to prolonged laryngospasm in a patient with Parkinson's disease, and (2) to review the literature on stridor in Parkinson's disease. \n The authors describe a patient experiencing stridor and dysphagia with confirmed pulmonary restriction and aspiration following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulator adjustment, with a resolution of symptoms and signs when the stimulator was switched off. \n Do Parkinson's disease patients experience stridor?",

        "question": "While detailed histological subtyping remains the best independent predictor of aggressive behavior in the majority of cases, evidence suggests that the additional analyses of FGFR4, MMP, PTTG, Ki-67, p53, and deletions in chromosome 11 may contribute to decisions concerning management of aggressive pituitary adenomas. \n We observed elevation of MMP-2 and -9 expression and consequent 3-D cell invasion in cells under-expressing RECK.  \n  Based on the significance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) for tumor growth and angiogenesis, we have studied the effect of batimastat (BB-94), a synthetic MMPs inhibitor (MMPI) on the progression of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma in rats.  \n Inhibition of estrogen-induced pituitary tumor growth and angiogenesis in Fischer 344 rats by the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat. \n The results of our study provide evidence for an inhibitory effect of batimastat, a synthetic MMPI, on the growth and angiogenesis in an experimental model of human prolactinoma. \n In summary, the differential expression of extracellular matrix components, integrins and matrix metalloproteinase contributes to the control of pituitary hormone production and cell proliferation during tumorigenesis. \n Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP-9).  \n We found no correlation of MMP-9 expression and tumour invasion. \n The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes. \n CONCLUSIONS: TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 may play a key role in invasive pituitary adenomas to biological behavior. \n The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-containing endopeptidases that are able to degrade the extracellular matrix and allow angiogenesis and tumor invasion.  \n MMP-9 expression did not differ between noninvasive tumors and normal pituitary gland, or between different sized prolactinomas. MMP-9 expression was related to aggressive tumor behavior. It was higher in invasive macroprolactinomas (P = 0.003) when compared with noninvasive macroprolactinomas or the normal anterior pituitary gland. In addition, although there was no difference in whether MMP-9 was present or not when nonfunctioning adenomas that recurred were compared with those that did not, samples of recurrent tumor at the second presentation were more likely to express MMP-9 (P = 0.01). Pituitary carcinomas were significantly more likely to be MMP-9 positive compared with normal anterior pituitary gland (P = 0.05), but there was no difference from invasive adenomas. Angiogenesis assessed by vascular density was related to MMP-9 expression (P<0.05). In summary, we have shown the presence of MMP-9 expression in some invasive and recurrent pituitary adenomas, and in the majority of pituitary carcinoma. The mechanisms whereby MMP-9 expression influences tumor recurrence and invasiveness, and its association with angiogenesis, remains to be elucidated.  \n Beside the digestion of the extracellular matrix during tumor invasion and metastasis, more recently, new functions for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been proposed.  \n CONCLUSION: No correlation could be established between the invasive potential of tumors and MMP-1, -2, and -3 expression levels.  \n Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 expression correlated with cavernous sinus invasion of pituitary adenomas. \n Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. \n We found surprisingly high levels of MMP activity and low levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, indicating a high level of extracellular matrix-degrading activity in pituitary adenomas. \n Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. \n We found surprisingly high levels of MMP activity and low levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, indicating a high level of extracellular matrix-degrading activity in pituitary adenomas. \n Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 expression correlated with cavernous sinus invasion of pituitary adenomas. \n The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes.  \n Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP-9).  \n Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 expression correlated with cavernous sinus invasion of pituitary adenomas. \n The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes.  \n Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP-9).  \n Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 expression correlated with cavernous sinus invasion of pituitary adenomas. \n The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes.  \n Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP-9).  \n Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 expression correlated with cavernous sinus invasion of pituitary adenomas. \n The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes.  \n Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP-9).  \n Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 expression correlated with cavernous sinus invasion of pituitary adenomas. \n The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes.  \n Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP-9).  \n We found surprisingly high levels of MMP activity and low levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, indicating a high level of extracellular matrix-degrading activity in pituitary adenomas. \n There was an association between the invasion of pituitary adenomas and Ki-67 LI (P = 0.039) or the expression of VEGF (P &lt; 0.001) and MMP-9 (P &lt; 0.001).

        "question": "Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) has been shown to have protective effects against damage caused by UV radiation and to reduce the rate of new premalignant actinic keratoses. \n ESULTS: At 12 months, the rate of new nonmelanoma skin cancers was lower by 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4 to 38) in the nicotinamide group than in the placebo group (P=0.02). Similar differences were found between the nicotinamide group and the placebo group with respect to new basal-cell carcinomas (20% [95% CI, -6 to 39]lower rate with nicotinamide, P=0.12) and new squamous-cell carcinomas (30% [95% CI, 0 to 51] lower rate, P=0.05). The number of actinic keratoses was 11% lower in the nicotinamide group than in the placebo group at 3 months (P=0.01), 14% lower at 6 months (P<0.001), 20% lower at 9 months (P<0.001), and 13% lower at 12 months (P=0.001). \n CONCLUSIONS: Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients. \n Nicotinamide is a safe, widely available vitamin that reduces the immune suppressive effects of UV, enhances DNA repair in keratinocytes and has shown promise in the chemoprevention of non-melanoma skin cancer.  \n  In summary, nicotinamide, by enhancing DNA repair in melanocytes, is a potential agent for the chemoprevention of cutaneous melanoma. \n Recent double-blinded randomized controlled Phase 2 studies in heavily sun-damaged individuals have shown that oral nicotinamide significantly reduces premalignant actinic keratoses, and may reduce new non-melanoma skin cancers.  \n Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) prevents UV-induced immunosuppression and carcinogenesis in mice, and solar-simulated (ss) UV-induced immunosuppression in humans. \n These results show that nicotinamide enhances two different pathways for repair of UV-induced photolesions, supporting nicotinamide's potential as an inexpensive, convenient and non-toxic agent for skin cancer chemoprevention. \n Recent double-blinded randomized controlled Phase 2 studies in heavily sun-damaged individuals have shown that oral nicotinamide significantly reduces premalignant actinic keratoses, and may reduce new non-melanoma skin cancers. \n No noteworthy between-group differences were found with respect to the number or types of adverse events during the 12-month intervention period, and there was no evidence of benefit after nicotinamide was discontinued.CONCLUSIONS: Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients.  \n Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) has been shown to have protective effects against damage caused by UV radiation and to reduce the rate of new premalignant actinic keratoses.METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 386 participants who had had at least two nonmelanoma skin cancers in the previous 5 years to receive 500 mg of nicotinamide twice

        "question": "In this review, we present the positive results of recently published clinical trials regarding therapy for IPF, with emphasis on pirfenidone and nintedanib. \n Nintedanib: evidence for its therapeutic potential in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis \n  In the Phase II TOMORROW trial, treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily showed a trend to slow the decline in lung function and significantly decrease acute exacerbations in patients with IPF, while showing an acceptable safety profile. The Phase III INPULSIS trials demonstrated a significant decrease in the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity in IPF patients treated with 150 mg nintedanib twice daily. In the INPULSIS-2 trial, the time to the first acute exacerbation significantly increased in IPF patients who were treated with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily. \n  Effects on collagen secretion were compared with those of the drugs nintedanib and pirfenidone, recently approved for IPF. \n Nintedanib, an orally available, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with selectivity for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors has recently been shown, in two pivotal phase III studies, to effectively slow IPF disease progression. Consequently, nintedanib was given accelerated approval by the FDA in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF.  \n Most recently, pirfenidone and nintedanib, two compounds with pleiotropic anti-fibrotic properties, have been proven effective in reducing functional decline and disease progression in IPF.  \n Meningococcal group B vaccine (Trumenba) to prevent more types of invasive meningococcal disease; antihemophilic factor (recombinant), porcine sequence (Obizur) to treat bleeding from acquired hemophilia A; and pirfenidone (Esbriet) and nintedanib (Ofev) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. \n  More importantly, the period ends with the publication of two groundbreaking studies that confirmed that two drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, slowed disease progression, leading to a historic approval by the FDA.  \n Nintedanib (Ofev(\u00ae)) is an orally available, small, multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed by Boehringer Ingelheim for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and cancer. Nintedanib received its first global approval in the US in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF. Nintedanib has received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the treatment of IPF, and for the second-line treatment in combination with docetaxel of locally advanced, metastatic or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma tumour histology.  \n This article summarizes the milestones in the development of nintedanib leading to this first approval for IPF. \n Efficacy and safety of nintedanib in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. \n Nintedanib: a novel therapeutic approach for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. \n Nintedanib is in clinical development as a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). \n Reducing lung function decline in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: potential of nintedanib. \n These results suggest that nintedanib may impact the progressive course of fibrotic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. \n Findings from recently published placebo-controlled trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have established that pirfenidone and nintedanib prevent about 50% of the decline in forced vital capacity typically seen in this disease; future trials are therefore unlikely to use placebo as a control group for ethical reasons. \n Nintedanib: a novel therapeutic approach for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. \n Nintedanib is in clinical development as a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). \n The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib (BIBF 1120) is in clinical development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. \n These results suggest that nintedanib may impact the progressive course of fibrotic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. \n A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. \n Findings from recently published placebo-controlled trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have established that pirfenidone and nintedanib prevent about 50% of the decline in forced vital capacity typically seen in this disease; future trials are therefore unlikely to use placebo as a control group for ethical reasons. \n A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  \n Data from the Phase II TOMORROW study suggested that nintedanib 150\ufffdmg twice daily had clinical benefits with an acceptable safety profile.METHODS: The INPULSIS\ufffd trials are replicate Phase III, randomized, double-blind, studies comparing the efficacy and safety of nintedanib 150\ufffdmg twice daily with placebo in patients with IPF.  \n Nintedanib received its first global approval in the US in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF.  \n A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  \n Data from the Phase II TOMORROW study suggested that nintedanib 150\ufffdmg twice daily had clinical benefits with an acceptable safety profile.METHODS: The INPULSIS\ufffd trials are replicate Phase III, randomized, double-blind, studies comparing the efficacy and safety of nintedanib 150\ufffdmg twice daily with placebo in patients with IPF.  \n Nintedanib received its first global approval in the US in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF.  \n A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  \n Data from the Phase II TOMORROW study suggested that nintedanib 150\ufffdmg twice daily had clinical benefits with an acceptable safety profile.METHODS: The INPULSIS\ufffd trials are replicate Phase III, randomized, double-blind, studies comparing the efficacy and safety of nintedanib 150\ufffdmg twice daily with placebo in patients with IPF.  \n Nintedanib received its first global approval in the US in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF.  \n The most frequent adverse event in the nintedanib groups was diarrhea, with rates of 61.5% and 18.6% in the nintedanib and placebo groups, respectively, in INPULSIS-1 and 63.2% and 18.3% in the two groups, respectively, in INPULSIS-2.

        "question": "Nod1 and Nod2 control bacterial infections and inflammation \n The Nod proteins Nod1 and Nod2 are two NLR family members that trigger immune defense in response to bacterial peptidoglycan \n Nod proteins fight off bacterial infections by stimulating proinflammatory signaling and cytokine networks and by inducing antimicrobial effectors, such as nitric oxide and antimicrobial peptides. \n Nod1 is also critically implicated in shaping adaptive immune responses towards bacterial-derived constituents. \n Together, Nod1 and Nod2 represent central players in the control of immune responses to bacterial infections and inflammation. \n The innate immune receptor Nod1 protects the intestine from inflammation-induced tumorigenesis. \n we show that Nod1 deficiency results in the increased development of both colitis-associated and Apc tumor suppressor-related colon tumors. In the absence of Nod1 signaling, there is a greater disruption of the intestinal epithelial cell barrier due to chemically induced injury as manifested by increased surface epithelial apoptosis early on during chemically induced colitis and increased intestinal permeability. \n The increased intestinal permeability is associated with enhanced inflammatory cytokine production and epithelial cell proliferation in Nod1-deficient mice as compared with wild-type mice. \n Depletion of the gut microbiota suppressed tumor development in Nod1-deficient mice, thus highlighting a link between the commensal bacteria within the intestine and the host innate immune Nod1 signaling pathway in the regulation inflammation-mediated colon cancer development. \n  NOD1 protein is expressed in the eye and promotes ocular inflammation in a dose- and time-dependent fashion.  \n NOD1 expression in the eye and functional contribution to IL-1beta-dependent ocular inflammation in mice \n Polymorphisms in NOD1 are associated with autoinflammatory diseases characterized by uveitis such as Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis \n NOD1 is homologous to NOD2, which is responsible for an autosomal dominant form of uveitis. Nonetheless, the role of NOD1 in intraocular inflammation has not been explored. \n Nod1 and Nod2 regulation of inflammation in the Salmonella colitis model \n mice deficient for both Nod1 and Nod2 had attenuated inflammatory pathology, reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, and increased colonization of the mucosal tissue \n The present study has demonstrated an unexpected role of Nod1 in the development of site-specific vascular inflammation, especially coronary arteritis. \n Nod1 ligands induce site-specific vascular inflammation \n Phenotyping of Nod1/2 double deficient mice and characterization of Nod1/2 in systemic inflammation and associated renal disease \n The present study analyzed Nod1 and Nod2 double deficient (Nod1/2 DKO) mice under physiological and inflammatory conditions \n Several inflammatory disorders, such as Crohn's disease and asthma, are linked to genetic changes in either Nod1 or Nod2. \n Systematic analysis of Nod1/2 DKO mice revealed a possible role of Nod1/2 in the development of renal disease during systemic inflammation. \n NOD1 and NOD2 Signaling in Infection and Inflammation \n NOD1 engagement generates an inflammatory response via activation of NF\u03baB and MAPK pathways.  \n In addition we profile novel inhibitors of RIP2 and NOD1 itself, which specifically inhibit NOD1 ligand induced inflammatory signalling in the vasculature.  \n This data supports the potential utility of NOD1 and RIP2 as therapeutic targets in human disease where vascular inflammation is a clinical feature, such as in sepsis and septic shock. \n NOD1 expression elicited by iE-DAP in first trimester human trophoblast cells and its potential role in infection-associated inflammation \n This study aimed to investigate the expression and function of NOD1 in first trimester trophoblast cells, and evaluate the potential role of trophoblast cells in infection-associated inflammation \n NOD1 may have a role in mediating infection-associated inflammation. Once iE-DAP is recognized by NOD1, the inflammatory response may be induced via NOD1-RICK-NF-\u03baB-mediated pathways. \n NOD1/2(-/-) mice were protected from HFD-induced inflammation, lipid accumulation, and peripheral insulin intolerance. \n In contrast, Nod1 gene-deficient mice developed enhanced joint inflammation with concomitant elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and cartilage damage, consistent with a model in which Nod1 controls the inflammatory reaction. \n These data indicate that the NLR family members Nod1 and Nod2 have different functions in controlling inflammation, and that intracellular Nod1-Nod2 interactions may determine the severity of arthritis in this experimental model. \n Whereas the lymphotoxin pathway was critical for the induction of the B cell chemoattractant CXCL13 in response to Nod1 agonists, B cell accumulation within the spleen following Nod1-induced systemic inflammation was independent of the lymphotoxin pathway. \n The effect of NOD1 and NOD2 activation on inflammation and the insulin signalling pathway was also assessed. \n Nonetheless, the role of NOD1 in intraocular inflammation has not been explored. \n A key role for the endothelium in NOD1 mediated vascular inflammation: comparison to TLR4 responses. \n We previously demonstrated that human first-trimester trophoblasts express Nod1 and Nod2, which trigger

This randomized, open-label, international, phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune-checkpoint-inhibitor antibody, as compared with docetaxel in this patient population. \n CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced, previously treated squamous-cell NSCLC, overall survival, response rate, and progression-free survival were significantly better with nivolumab than with docetaxel, regardless of PD-L1 expression level. \n Agents currently in active clinical development for lung cancer include ipilimumab, which modulates the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 pathway, and multiple agents targeting the programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway, both anti-PD-1 compounds (nivolumab, pembrolizumab [MK-3475]) and those that target programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a key ligand for PD-1 (BMS-936559, MPDL3280A). \n Overall Survival and Long-Term Safety of Nivolumab (Anti-Programmed Death 1 Antibody, BMS-936558, ONO-4538) in Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. \n We report overall survival (OS), response durability, and long-term safety in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving nivolumab in this trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 129) with heavily pretreated advanced NSCLC received nivolumab 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg intravenously once every 2 weeks in 8-week cycles for up to 96 weeks.  \n CONCLUSION: Nivolumab monotherapy produced durable responses and encouraging survival rates in patients with heavily pretreated NSCLC.

        "question": "CONCLUSIONS: In this 6-week study, reduced-nicotine cigarettes versus standard-nicotine cigarettes reduced nicotine exposure and dependence and the number of cigarettes smoked.  \n RESULTS: Significant reductions in nicotine intake were observed between usual brand smoking (\u223c1.2 mg nicotine) and the 0.3 and 0.05 mg nicotine emission cigarettes, but not the 0.6 mg cigarette. \n CONCLUSIONS: The study adds to the evidence that cigarettes with markedly reduced nicotine content are not associated with increased smoking intensity or exposure to smoke toxicants. \n BACKGROUND: When switching from usual brand cigarettes, very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes lead to a reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked, toxicant exposure, withdrawal symptoms and dependence.  \n Moreover, while nicotine patches were well tolerated when subjects smoked nicotine-containing cigarettes, the use of nicotine skin patches with reduced-nicotine cigarettes potentially offers the advantage of increased efficacy without introducing concern about toxic effects of excessive nicotine intake. \n Results showed that Quest plus NRT was more effective than active control plus NRT in achieving 4 weeks of continuous abstinence (32.8% vs. 21.9%). \n Quest plus NRT offers promise as a new smoking cessation treatment. \n We identified three clinical trials (total n = 489) that suggest that smokers can dissociate nicotine delivery from the act of smoking if they use reduced-nicotine content cigarettes in combination with nicotine replacement therapy. \n CONCLUSION: The 0.05 mg nicotine yield cigarettes may be a tobacco product that can facilitate cessation; however, future research is clearly needed to support these preliminary findings. \n Preliminary studies suggest an extinction-based smoking cessation treatment using reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes decreases self-report craving for cigarettes prior to quitting and may be an effective smoking cessation treatment. \n Reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes have led to smoking fewer cigarettes, withdrawal relief, and facilitation of cessation. \n Evidence from a number of small smoking cessation studies suggests that the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content, in combination with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), may help reduce withdrawal symptoms and increase quit rates. \n The concept for a reduced-nicotine cigarette designed to progressively wean smokers from the smoking habit is based on research demonstrating that successful smoking cessation is not only dependent on withdrawal of nicotine, but also on weaning from the habitual sensory and behavioral reinforcement of smoking. \n Preliminary studies suggest an extinction-based smoking cessation treatment using reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes decreases self-report craving for cigarettes prior to quitting and may be an effective smoking cessation treatment. \n The concept for a reduced-nicotine cigarette designed to progressively wean smokers from the smoking habit is based on research demonstrating that successful smoking cessation is not only dependent on withdrawal of nicotine, but also on weaning from the habitual sensory and behavioral reinforcement of smoking. \n Evidence from a number of small smoking cessation studies suggests that the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content, in combination with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), may help reduce withdrawal symptoms and increase quit rates. \n Preliminary studies suggest an extinction-based smoking cessation treatment using reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes decreases self-report craving for cigarettes prior to quitting and may be an effective smoking cessation treatment \n Specifically, standards that required substantially reduced nicotine content in cigarettes could enable cessation in smokers and prevent future smoking among current non-smokers \n Reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarettes have led to smoking fewer cigarettes, withdrawal relief, and facilitation of cessation \n Evidence from a number of small smoking cessation studies suggests that the use of cigarettes with reduced nicotine content, in combination with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), may help reduce withdrawal symptoms and increase quit rates \n The concept for a reduced-nicotine cigarette designed to progressively wean smokers from the smoking habit is based on research demonstrating that successful smoking cessation is not only dependent on withdrawal of nicotine, but also on weaning from the habitual sensory and behavioral reinforcement of smoking \n These results suggest that use of NRT before a target quit-smoking date deserves further evaluation as a possible smoking cessation treatment.

The regulation of these proteins, their interaction with DNA, and their co-occurrence in the genome, may be responsible for the plasticity of 3D chromatin architecture that dictates cell and time-specific blueprints of gene expression. \n The role of 3D genome organisation in the control and execution of lineage-specific transcription programmes during the development and differentiation of multipotent stem cells into specialised cell types remains poorly understood. \n Chromatin structural states and their remodelling, including higher-order chromatin folding and three-dimensional (3D) genome organisation, play an important role in the control of gene expression \n Here, we show that substantial remodelling of the higher-order chromatin structure of the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC), a keratinocyte lineage-specific gene locus on mouse chromosome 3, occurs during epidermal morphogenesis. \n Many studies have suggested a link between the spatial organization of genomes and fundamental biological processes such as genome reprogramming, gene expression, and differentiation. \n Moreover, we reveal that formation of such highly condensed, transcriptionally repressed heterochromatin promotes transcriptional activation of differentiation genes and loss of pluripotency. \n The open chromatin of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) condenses into repressive heterochromatin as cells exit the pluripotent state. \n we find that localized heterochromatin condensation of ribosomal RNA genes initiates establishment of highly condensed chromatin structures outside of the nucleolus \n We focus on the emerging relationship between genome organization and lineage-specific transcriptional regulation, which we argue are inextricably linked. \n Cells face the challenge of storing two meters of DNA in the three-dimensional (3D) space of the nucleus that spans only a few microns. The nuclear organization that is required to overcome this challenge must allow for the accessibility of the gene regulatory machinery to the DNA and, in the case of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), for the transcriptional and epigenetic changes that accompany differentiation \n In this review we summarize some of the recent findings illuminating the 3D structure of the eukaryotic genome, as well as the relationship between genome topology and function from the level of whole chromosomes to enhancer-promoter loops with a focus on features affecting genome organization in ESCs and changes in nuclear organization during differentiation \n We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between domains change in a striking manner, altering 36% of active and inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the genome \n Does the 3D structure of  the genome remain stable during cell differentiation?",

        "question": "The emerging revolutionary technique of optogenetics enables manipulation of the activity of specific neuronal populations in vivo with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution using light. We used optogenetic approaches to test the role of hippocampal excitatory neurons in the lithium-pilocarpine model of acute elicited seizures in awake behaving rats. \n This chapter focuses on the development of optogenetics and on-demand technologies for the study of epilepsy and the control of seizures. \n We then turn to the use of optogenetics, including on-demand optogenetics in the study of epilepsies, which highlights the powerful potential of optogenetics for epilepsy research. \n Optogenetic techniques provide powerful tools for bidirectional control of neuronal activity and investigating alterations occurring in excitability disorders, such as epilepsy. \n  Therefore, one could optogenetically activate specific or a mixed population of interneurons and dissect their selective or concerted inhibitory action on principal cells. We chose to explore a conceptually novel strategy involving simultaneous activation of mixed populations of interneurons by optogenetics and study their impact on ongoing epileptiform activity in mouse acute hippocampal slices. \n Our data suggest that global optogenetic activation of mixed interneuron populations is a more effective approach for development of novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy, but the initial action potential generation in principal neurons needs to be taken in consideration. \n Recently, a number of experiments have explored the treatments for epilepsy with optogenetic control of neurons. Here, we discuss the possibility that an optogenetic approach could be used to control the release of gliotransmitters and improve astrocyte function such as glutamate and K(+) uptake, and thereby offer a potential strategy to investigate and treat astrocyte-related epilepsy. \n Optogenetic and designer receptor technologies provide unprecedented and much needed specificity, allowing for spatial, temporal and cell type-selective modulation of neuronal circuits.

        "question": "Since this region partially overlaps with residues previously implicated in block of the channel by omega-conotoxin GVIA, we assessed the effects of mutations in the putative EF hand domain on channel block by omega-conotoxin GVIA and the structurally related omega-conotoxin MVIIA. Both of the toxins irreversibly block the activity of wild type alpha(1B) N-type channels.  \n Despite their high sequence homology, the peptide neurotoxins omega-conotoxin MVIIA and MVIIC selectively block N- and P/Q-type calcium channels, respectively.  \n  Binding assay for both N- and P/Q-type calcium channels showed that amino acid residues restricted to the N-terminal half are important for the recognition of N-type channels, whereas essential residues for P/Q-type channel recognition are widely spread over the whole omega-conotoxin molecule. \n Ziconotide is a novel peptide that blocks the entry of calcium into neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, preventing the conduction of nerve signals. \n Ziconotide is a selective, potent and reversible blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs). \n The therapeutic benefit of ziconotide derives from its potent and selective blockade of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels. \n Interactions of intrathecally administered ziconotide, a selective blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, with morphine on nociception in rats. \n Ziconotide, a new N-type calcium channel blocker, administered intrathecally for acute postoperative pain. \n Ziconotide, an intrathecally administered N-type calcium channel antagonist for the treatment of chronic pain. \n Thus, ziconotide is the first of a new class of agents--N-type calcium channel blockers, or NCCBs. \n Ziconotide, formerly known also as SNX- 111, represents a new class of agents, the N-type calcium channel blockers. \n The selective N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide ameliorates severe chronic pain but has a narrow therapeutic window and requires intrathecal administration. \n A selective N-type calcium channel inhibitor, ziconotide (Prialt), is a neuroactive peptide recently marketed as a novel nonopioid treatment for severe chronic pain. \n As the clinically available analgesics, pregabalin (alpha2delta-subunit calcium channel ligand), ziconotide (N-type calcium channel blocker), mexiletine (sodium channel blocker), and duloxetine (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) were evaluated in these neurochemically-induced allodynia models. \n Ziconotide, a new N-type calcium channel blocker, administered intrathecally for acute postoperative pain. \n Ziconotide, an intrathecally administered N-type calcium channel antagonist for the treatment of chronic pain. \n The present investigation was designed to assess the safety and analgesic efficacy of ziconotide, a new N-type calcium channel blocker, when administered intrathecally to patients with acute postoperative pain. \n Inhibition of the N-type calcium channel by intrathecal administration of the channel-specific blocker omega-conotoxin MVIIA (ziconotide) is efficacious in the treatment of severe chronic pain. \n Ziconotide, formerly known also as SNX- 111, represents a new class of agents, the N-type calcium channel blockers. \n Ziconotide is a powerful analgesic drug that has a unique mechanism of action involving potent and selective block of N-type calcium channels, which

        "question": "Escherichia coli rnhA mutants devoid of RNase HI exhibit constitutive stable DNA replication, cSDR, which is thought to be initiated from R-loops stabilized in the absence of RNase HI. \n We propose that the organized structure of the R-loop is critical for primer RNA function in vivo with important implications for the RNA processing and DNA replication machinery. \n The precursor primer RNA exists as a persistent RNA-DNA hybrid, known as an R-loop, formed during transcription through the replication origin (Xu, B., and Clayton, D. A. (1996) EMBO J. 15, 3135-3143). \n We found that overproduction of RecG protein drastically decreased copy numbers of ColE1-type plasmids, which require R-loop formation between the template DNA and a primer RNA transcript (RNA II) for the initiation of replication. \n These results suggest that overproduced RecG inhibits the initiation of replication by prematurely resolving the R-loops formed at the replication origin region of these plasmids with its unique helicase activity. The possibility that RecG regulates the initiation of a unique mode of DNA replication, oriC-independent constitutive stable DNA replication, by its activity in resolving R-loops is discussed. \n We propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome. This would allow replication to proceed while the original block is repaired or bypassed \n Furthermore, increased RNaseH expression significantly alleviated genomic instability in deficient fibroblasts suggesting that cotranscriptional R-loops formation contributes to the genesis of replication-dependent DSBs in these cells. \n Transcription is an important source of replicative stress and consequently, maintenance of genome integrity requires the protection of chromosomes from the deleterious effects arising from the interaction between nascent RNAs and template DNA, leading to stable DNA-RNA hybrids (R-loop) formation. \n Strikingly, we found that attenuation of replication strongly suppresses R-loop-mediated DNA rearrangements in both E. coli and HeLa cells. \n More importantly, we then show that R-loop formation causes DNA replication fork stalling, and that this in fact underlies the effects of R loops on genomic stabilit \n R-loop-mediated genomic instability is caused by impairment of replication fork progression \n When any of these processes are not properly coordinated, aberrant outcomes such as fork reversal and R-loop formation arise and trigger unscheduled recombinogenic events and genome rearrangements.  \n Many studies show that cells can manage R loop formation with efficiency, and can also process the R-loops already formed in the cell, and by which, the bad effects of R-loops on DNA replication, gene mutation and homologous recombination can be regulated. \n Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells.  \n In agreement with this, we found that R-loops co-localize with the ORC within the same CpG island region in a significant fraction of these efficient replication origins, precisely at the position displaying the highest density of G4 motifs.  \n connection between transcription and replication in human cells and suggests that R-loop dysregulation at CpG island promoter-origins might contribute to the phenotype of DNA replication abnormalities and loss of genome integrity detected in cancer cells. \n We show that RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) form at sites of transcription/replication collisions and that RNase H1 functions to suppress CFS instability. \n R-loops and initiation of DNA replication in human cells: a missing link? \n Stable RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) prime the initiation of replication in Escherichia coli cells. \n We propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome. \n Immediately after infection, RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) occur on (at least some) replication origins, with the annealed RNA serving as a primer for leading-strand synthesis in one direction. \n Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells. \n ColE1 plasmid origins of replication and oriK sites initiate primosome assembly by an RNA-DNA hybrid structure known as R-loop. \n This scenario builds on the connection between transcription and replication in human cells and suggests that R-loop dysregulation at CpG island promoter-origins might contribute to the phenotype of DNA replication abnormalities and loss of genome integrity detected in cancer cells. \n The multiple cleavage sites on the R-loop substrate match the priming sites observed in vivo, suggesting that RNase MRP alone is capable of generating virtually all of the leading-strand replication primers. \n R-loops and initiation of DNA replication in human cells: a missing link? \n Mechanisms of primer RNA synthesis and D-loop/R-loop-dependent DNA replication in Escherichia coli. \n We show that RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) form at sites of transcription/replication collisions and that RNase H1 functions to suppress CFS instability. \n Alternative oriC-independent modes of replication initiation are possible, one of which is constitutive stable DNA replication (cSDR) from transcription-associated RNA-DNA hybrids or R-loops. \n R-loops and initiation of DNA replication in human cells: a missing link?

D \n Our data suggest that aberrant epigenetic regulation of neuropsychiatric genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD. \n We conclude that smoking reliably decreases MAOA methylation, but exact characterization of effects on level of methylation depend on genotype, smoking history, current smoking status, gender, and region of the promoter-associated CpG Island examined. \n Given that DNA methylation is linked to the regulation of gene expression, we hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms factor into the MAOA expression \n  the extended MAOA regulatory region contains two CpG islands (CGIs), one of which overlaps with the canonical MAOA promoter and the other is located further upstream; both CGIs exhibit sensitivity to differential methylation. \n Identification and characterization of putative methylation targets in the MAOA locus using bioinformatic approaches. \n DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism involved in the developmental regulation of gene expression.  \n MAOA methylation is associated with nicotine and alcohol dependence in women. \n In recent years, the role of epigenetic phenomenon, such as methylation, in mediating vulnerability to behavioral illness has become increasingly appreciated. One prominent locus at which epigenetic phenomena are thought to be in play is the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) locus.  \n We conclude that methylation of MAOA may play a significant role in common psychiatric illness and that further examination of epigenetic processes at this locus is in order. \n Analysis of CpG methylation in the MAOA promoter region revealed substantial methylation in females but not in males. \n Therefore, allelic mRNA expression is affected by genetic and epigenetic events, both with the potential to modulate biogenic amine tone in the CNS. \n Is the gene MAOA epigenetically modified by methylation?",

        "question": "A phase I trial of vertical inhibition of IGF signalling using cixutumumab, an anti-IGF-1R antibody, and selumetinib, an MEK 1/2 inhibitor, in advanced solid tumours. \n BACKGROUND: We completed a phase I clinical trial to test the safety and toxicity of combined treatment with cixutumumab (anti-IGF-1R antibody) and selumetinib (MEK 1/2 inhibitor). \n Two patients achieved a partial response (one unconfirmed), including a patient with BRAF wild-type thyroid carcinoma, and a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, and six patients achieved time to progression of>6 months, including patients with thyroid carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. \n CONCLUSIONS: Our study of anti-IGF-1R antibody cixutumumab and MEK 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib showed that the combination is safe and well-tolerated at these doses, with preliminary evidence of clinical benefit and pharmacodynamic evidence of target inhibition. \n MHC class I loss is a frequent mechanism of immune escape in papillary thyroid cancer that is reversed by interferon and selumetinib treatment in vitro. \n Increased antigenicity following selumetinib and IFN treatment warrants further study for immunotherapy of progressive PTC. \n The role of KIs in differentiated TC may be revolutionised by the finding that selumetinib may restore a clinical response to radioactive iodine (RAI).  \n BACKGROUND AND AIM: Selumetinib is a promising and interesting targeted therapy agent as it may reverse radioiodine uptake in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. \n CONCLUSIONS: Compared with current chemotherapy, selumetinib has modest clinical activity as monotherapy in patients with advanced cancer, but combinations of selumetinib with cytotoxic agents in patients with BRAF or KRAS mutations hold great promise for cancer treatment. \n Selumetinib may be an effective redifferentiating agent and could be used within several years. \n Selumetinib-enhanced radioiodine uptake in advanced thyroid cancer. \n METHODS: We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer.  \n Selumetinib increased the uptake of iodine-124 in 12 of the 20 patients (4 of 9 patients with BRAF mutations and 5 of 5 patients with NRAS mutations). \n CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib produces clinically meaningful increases in iodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioiodine;

Our results indicate that when combined with IDH status, TERT promoter mutation contributes to prognostic subgroups of lower-grade astrocytic tumors or 1p/19q intact lower-grade gliomas and this may further refine future molecular classification of lower-grade gliomas. \n RESULTS: TERTp-mut identified in 60.8% of gliomas (491 out of 807) was globally associated with poorer outcome (Hazard ratio (HR)=1.50).  \n TERT promoter mutations lead to high transcriptional activity under hypoxia and temozolomide treatment and predict poor prognosis in gliomas. \n Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age. \n TERT promoter mutations maintained its ability of inducing high transcriptional activity even under hypoxic and TMZ treatment conditions, and the presence of mutations was associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients.  \n Patients whose Grade III-IV gliomas exhibit TERT promoter mutations alone predominately have primary GBMs associated with poor median OS (11.5 months). Patients whose Grade III-IV gliomas exhibit IDH1/2 mutations alone predominately have astrocytic morphologies and exhibit a median OS of 57 months while patients whose tumors exhibit both TERT promoter and IDH1/2 mutations predominately exhibit oligodendroglial morphologies and exhibit median OS of 125 months. \n Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age.CONCLUSION: TERT promoter mutations were specific to gliomas.  \n We defined, based on TERTp-mut and IDH mutation status, four prognostic groups: (1) TERTp-mut and IDH-mut associated with 1p19q codeletion, overall survival (OS)>17 years; (2) TERTp-wt and IDH-mut, associated with TP53 mutation, OS=97.5 months; (3) TERTp-wt and IDH-wt, with no specific association, OS=31.6 months; (4) TERTp-mut and IDH-wt, associated with EGFR amplification, OS=15.4 months.  \n Mutations lead to TERT upregulation and are associated with aggressive clinical behavior in glioblastomas.  \n We defined, based on TERTp-mut and IDH mutation status, four prognostic groups: (1) TERTp-mut and IDH-mut associated with 1p19q codeletion, overall survival (OS)>17 years; (2) TERTp-wt and IDH-mut, associated with TP53 mutation, OS=97.5 months; (3) TERTp-wt and IDH-wt, with no specific association, OS=31.6 months; (4) TERTp-mut and IDH-wt, associated with EGFR amplification, OS=15.4 months.  \n We defined, based on TERTp-mut and IDH mutation status, four prognostic groups: (1) TERTp-mut and IDH-mut associated with 1p19q codeletion, overall survival (OS)>17 years; (2) TERTp-wt and IDH-mut, associated with TP53 mutation, OS=97.5 months; (3) TERTp-wt and IDH-wt, with no specific association, OS=31.6 months; (4) TERTp-mut and IDH-wt, associated with EGFR amplification, OS=15.4 months.  \n In the subset of 116 IDH-mutated lower-grade gliomas lacking 1p/19q codeletion, 19 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.027) and OS (P=0.004).  \n TERT promoter mutations maintained its ability of inducing high transcriptional activity even under hypoxic and TMZ treatment conditions, and the presence of mutations was associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients.  \n In the subset of 116 IDH-mutated lower-grade gliomas lacking 1p/19q codeletion, 19 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.027) and OS (P=0.004).  \n TERT promoter mutations maintained its ability of inducing high transcriptional activity even under hypoxic and TMZ treatment conditions, and the presence of mutations was associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients.  \n The mean age at diagnosis was lowest (37 years) among patients who had gliomas with only IDH mutations and was highest (59 years) among patients who had gliomas with only TERT mutations.

CTCF has a single paralogue, the testes-specific CTCF-like gene (CTCFL)/BORIS. CTCF and BORIS can be deregulated in cancer. The tumour suppressor gene CTCF can be mutated or deleted in cancer, or CTCF DNA binding can be altered by epigenetic changes. BORIS is aberrantly expressed frequently in cancer, leading some to propose a pro-tumourigenic role for BORIS. However, BORIS can inhibit cell proliferation, and is mutated in cancer similarly to CTCF suggesting BORIS activation in cancer may be due to global genetic or epigenetic changes typical of malignant transformation \n  The investigation of the molecular mechanisms engaged by CTCF to modulate tumor-related genes emphasizes the cell-type dependency of its tumor suppressor role. Indeed, the ability of CTCF to bind their promoters strictly depends by cell-type features as DNA methylation, BORIS-binding and post-translational modifications as PARYlation \n Moreover, reduction of CTCF in normally BORIS-negative human fibroblasts resulted in derepression of BORIS promoters.

        "question": "The aporphine alkaloids (+)-dicentrine and (+)-bulbocapnine are non-planar molecules lacking features normally associated with DNA binding by intercalation or minor groove binding. Surprisingly, dicentrine showed significant activity as a topoisomerase II (EC 5.99.1.3) inhibitor and also was active in a DNA unwinding assay. \n The DNA unwinding suggests DNA intercalation, which could explain the inhibition of topoisomerase II. \n We found that several agents, including adriamycin (a DNA intercalator and inhibitor of topoisomerase II) \n Amsacrine, a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor, is efficacious as an antileukemogenic agent. \n Quinacrine was less effective. (ii) Inhibitors intercalating and binding to the 'cleavable' DNA-topoisomerase complex (m-AMSA, mitoxantrone, doxorubicin and daunorubicin) strongly suppressed reparative DNA incision.  \n DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. \n Among its many properties, amiloride is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor. \n To determine whether the ability of amiloride to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit DNA topoisomerase II was dependent on the ability to assume a cyclized conformation, we studied the structure-activity relationship for 12 amiloride analogs \n Empirical assays consisting of biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, as well as computational molecular modeling approaches, were used to determine conformational properties for these molecules, and to determine whether they intercalated into DNA and inhibited topoisomerase II.  \n Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. Thus, the ability of amiloride and the 12 analogs studied to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit topoisomerase II appears dependent on the ability to exist in a planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic conformation. \n Abnormal expression of the nuclear-associated enzyme DNA topoisomerase II (topoisomerase II) has been implicated in the in vitro phenotype of radiation hypersensitive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) cells and in modifying sensitivity of eukaryotic cells to topoisomerase II-inhibitor drugs [e.g., the DNA intercalator amsacrine (mAMSA)].  \n All three tested anthraquinones, emodin, aloe-emodin, and danthron, showed capabilities to inhibit the non-covalent binding of bisbenzimide Hoechst 33342 to isolated DNA and in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells comparable to the topoisomerase II inhibitor and intercalator m-amsacrine. \n These studies suggest that AD 288 inhibits topoisomerase II activity by preventing the initial non-covalent binding of topoisomerase II to DNA. Since AD 288 is a potent DNA intercalator, catalytic inhibition is achieved by prohibiting access of the enzyme to DNA binding sites.  \n AQ4N (1,4-bis[[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl] amino]-5,8-dihydroxyanthracene-9, 10-dione bis-N-oxide dihydrochloride) is a prodrug which is selectively activated within hypoxic tissues to AQ4, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and DNA intercalator. \n Amonafide is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of neoplastic diseases. \n  We found that three compounds had similar cancer cell-selective growth inhibition to amonafide, while retaining similar subcellular localization, DNA intercalation and topoisomerase II inhibition activities. \n Amonafide is a novel topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitor and DNA intercalator that induces apoptotic signaling by blocking the binding of Topo II to DNA. \n At higher concentrations, inhibition of Top1 catalytic activity and DNA intercalation is observed. \n Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of new oligopyrrole carboxamides linked with tricyclic DNA-intercalators as potential DNA ligands or topoisomerase inhibitors. \n It was found that 1) morpholinyldoxorubicin, cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin, and Actinomycin D (but not doxorubicin) stimulated DNA topoisomerase I-induced cleavage at specific DNA sites; 2) only doxorubicin and Actinomycin D stimulated DNA cleavage by DNA topoisomerase II; 3) at higher drug concentrations, DNA intercalators suppressed enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage induced by DNA topoisomerase I, as well as topoisomerase II; 4) only cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin produced DNA-DNA cross-links; no DNA unwinding could be observed; and 5) DNA intercalation (unwinding) potency of morpholinyldoxorubicin was about 2-fold less than that of doxorubicin. \n The data indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I. \n The screen of cMAP for uncharacterized drugs indicated the signature of Epoxy anthraquinone derivative (EAD) matched the profiles of multiple known DNA targeted agents (topoisomerase I/II inhibitors, DNA intercalators, and DNA alkylation agents) as predicted by its structure. \n Cytotoxicity of several classes of antitumor DNA intercalators is thought to result from disturbance of DNA metabolism following trapping of the nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase II as a covalent complex on DNA. \n Most DNA intercalators and epipodophyllotoxins inhibit mammalian topoisomerase II by trapping the enzyme within DNA cleavage complexes that can be detected in cells as protein-associated DNA strand breaks. \n Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. \n Numerous topoisomerase I poisons including DNA minor groove binders such as Hoechst 33258 and DNA intercalators such as benzophenanthridine alkaloids and indolocarbazole derivatives have been discovered and developed. \n The stabilization of cleavage intermediates by intercalators may have a common mechanism for DNA topoisomerase I and DNA topoisomerase II. \n Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. \n Among its many properties, amiloride is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor. \n Taken together, our results suggest that much of the activity and specificity of m-AMSA as a topoisomerase II poison is embodied in the headgroup, while DNA intercalation is used primarily to increase the affinity of m-AMSA for the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex. \n Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. \n The cross-sensitivity patterns of the mutant were examined for covalently (anthramycin) and non-covalently (distamycin A) binding minor groove ligands, and DNA intercalating [adriamycin, mitoxantrone and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide (mAMSA)] and non-intercalating (VP16-213) topoisomerase II poisons. \n Quinoline alkaloids as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. \n DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. Structure-activity relationships for a series of amiloride analogs. \n These include: (i) the production of improved topoisomerase inhibitors (by consideration of drug/protein as well as drug/DNA interactions); (ii) the development of reductively-activated chromophores as hypoxia-selective agents; and (iii) the use of DNA-intercalators of known DNA binding orientation as 'carriers' for the delivery of other reactive functionality specifically (sequence-, regio- and site-specifically) to DNA. \n Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of new oligopyrrole carboxamides linked with tricyclic DNA-intercalators as potential DNA ligands or topoisomerase inhibitors. \n It was found that 1) morpholinyldoxorubicin, cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin, and Actinomycin D (but not doxorubicin) stimulated DNA topoisomerase I-induced cleavage at specific DNA sites; 2) only doxorubicin and Actinomycin D stimulated DNA cleavage by DNA topoisomerase II; 3) at higher drug concentrations, DNA intercalators suppressed enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage induced by DNA topoisomerase I, as well as topoisomerase II; 4) only cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin produced DNA-DNA cross-links; no DNA unwinding could be observed; and 5) DNA intercalation (unwinding) potency of morpholinyldoxorubicin was about 2-fold less than that of doxorubicin. \n The data indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I. \n Indolo[2,3-b]quinolines are a family of DNA intercalators and inhibitors of topoisomerase II, synthetic analogs of neocryptolepine, an alkaloid traditionally used in African folk medicine. \n Most DNA intercalators and epipodophyllotoxins inhibit mammalian topoisomerase II by trapping the enzyme within DNA cleavage complexes that can be detected in cells as protein-associated DNA strand breaks. \n Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. \n The stabilization of cleavage intermediates by intercalators may have a common mechanism for DNA topoisomerase I and DNA topoisomerase II. \n Their ability to function as bis-intercalators was assessed by a novel and convenient topoisomerase fluorescent assay. \n Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of new oligopyrrole carboxamides linked with tricyclic DNA-intercalators as potential DNA ligands or

that DNA intercalators can inhibit the action of amsacrine and several other topoisomerase II poisons, presumably as a result of interference with the DNA binding sites for the enzyme.  \n Most DNA

are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. \n Specifically, we measured the ability of these compounds to 1) alter the thermal denaturation profile of DNA, 2) modify the hydrodynamic behavior of DNA, 3) inhibit the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro, 4) promote the topoisomerase II-dependent cleavage of DNA, and 5) inhibit functions associated with DNA topoisomerase II in intact cells. Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. \n A function for topoisomerases I and II in DNA excision repair can be postulated from the organization of the mammalian chromosome, involving nucleosomal structures and matrix-attached DNA loops. To analyse this function we determined UV-induced DNA incision in confluent human fibroblasts in the presence of 16 inhibitors of topoisomerases I and II which belonged to at least five different drug categories, based on their mechanism of action. \n In experiments to determine the mechanism of inhibition of DNA synthesis by amiloride, we observed that amiloride inhibited both the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro and DNA topoisomerase II-dependent cell functions in vivo. Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. \n The pyridoacridines&apos; ability to inhibit TOPO II-mediated decatenation of kDNA correlated with their cytotoxic potencies and their ability to intercalate into calf thymus DNA. These results suggest that disruption of the function of TOPO II, subsequent to intercalation, is a probable mechanism by which pyridoacridines inhibit the proliferation of HCT cells. \n Evidence for DNA intercalation by AD41 is provided by the observation that the drug introduces positive supercoils into covalently closed plasmid DNA. Based on these data, a hypothesis is proposed that would provide a general mechanism whereby intercalating agents and epipodophyllotoxins alter topoisomerase function and presumably exert their antitumor effects. \n Therefore, to more fully analyze structure-function relationships and the role of DNA binding in the action of m-AMSA, we analyzed a series of derivatives for the ability to enhance DNA cleavage mediated by human topoisomerase II\u03b1 and topoisomerase II\u03b2 and to intercalate DNA. Results indicate that the 3&apos;-methoxy (m-AMSA) positively affects drug function, potentially by restricting the rotation of the headgroup in a favorable orientation. \n Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. \n Specifically, we measured the ability of these compounds to 1) alter the thermal denaturation profile of DNA, 2) modify the hydrodynamic behavior of DNA, 3) inhibit the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro, 4) promote the topoisomerase II-dependent cleavage of DNA, and 5) inhibit functions associated with DNA topoisomerase II in intact cells.

        "question": "Autophagy regulates amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked fused in sarcoma-positive stress granules in neurons \n However, the role of autophagy in regulation of FUS-positive stress granules (SGs) and aggregates remains unclear.  \n Profilin 1 associates with stress granules and ALS-linked mutations alter stress granule dynamics \n Here we report that profilin 1 and related protein profilin 2 are novel stress granule-associated proteins in mouse primary cortical neurons and in human cell lines and that ALS-linked mutations in profilin 1 alter stress granule dynamics, providing further evidence for the potential role of stress granules in ALS pathogenesis \n Furthermore, in response to oxidative stress or heat shock conditions in cultures and in vivo, the ALS-linked FUS mutants, but not wild-type FUS, assembled into perinuclear stress granules in proportion to their cytoplasmic expression levels. \n Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules. \n Our results suggest that the ALS mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism. \n Although co-localized primarily in the nucleus in normal condition, FUS/TLS and PRMT1 were partially recruited to the cytoplasmic granules under oxidative stress, which were merged with stress granules (SGs) markers in SH-SY5Y cell. \n The effect of PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation on the subcellular localization, stress granules, and detergent-insoluble aggregates of FUS/TLS \n Stress granules are cytoplasmic inclusions that repress translation of a subset of RNAs in times of cellular stress, and several proteins implicated in neurodegeneration (i.e. Ataxin-2 and SMN) interact with stress granules \n These findings support a two-hit hypothesis, whereby cytoplasmic mislocalization of FUS protein, followed by cellular stress, contributes to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates that may sequester FUS, disrupt RNA processing and initiate motor neuron degeneration. \n Here, we exploited a Drosophila model of ALS and neuronal cell lines to elucidate the role of the RNA-binding ability of FUS in regulating FUS-mediated toxicity, cytoplasmic mislocalization and incorporation into stress granules (SGs).  \n RNA-binding ability of FUS regulates neurodegeneration, cytoplasmic mislocalization and incorporation into stress granules associated with FUS carrying ALS-linked mutations. \n Stress granules as crucibles of ALS pathogenesis \n Recent work connecting TDP-43 and FUS to stress granules has suggested how this cellular pathway, which involves protein aggregation as part of its normal function, might be coopted during disease pathogenesis. \n Like several other ALS-associated proteins, CREST is recruited to induced stress granules. \n Our data indicate that CREST and certain other ALS-linked proteins share several features implicated in ALS pathogenesis, namely the ability to aggregate, be recruited to stress granules and alter paraspeckle integrity. \n A unifying feature of many proteins associated with ALS, including TDP-43 and ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules.  \n Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress. Since only the mutants, but not the endogenous wild-type FUS, are associated with stress granules under most of the stress conditions reported to date, the relationship between FUS and stress granules represents a mutant-specific phenotype and thus may be of significance in mutant-induced pathogenesis. \n Fused in sarcoma (FUS) belongs to the group of RNA-binding proteins implicated as underlying factors in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and certain other neurodegenerative diseases. Multiple FUS gene mutations have been linked to hereditary forms, and aggregation of FUS protein is believed to play an important role in pathogenesis of these diseases. In cultured cells, FUS variants with disease-associated amino acid substitutions or short deletions affecting nuclear localization signal (NLS) and causing cytoplasmic mislocalization can be sequestered into stress granules (SGs). \n TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that is known to regulate the splicing, transport, and storage of specific mRNAs into stress granules \n In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) accumulates in the cytoplasm of affected neurons and glia, where it associates with stress granules (SGs) and forms large inclusions \n Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress \n Autophagy regulates amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked fused in sarcoma-positive stress granules in neurons \n Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules \n Mutations in Fus cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the mutant protein forms inclusions that appear to correspond to stress granules \n We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested.  \n A unifying feature of many proteins associated with ALS, including TDP-43 and ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules.  \n Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress. \n Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress. \n Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress. \n SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). \n Two RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, aggregate in the degenerating motor neurons of ALS patients, and mutations in the genes encoding these proteins cause some forms of ALS. \n Recent work also suggests that TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic stress granules, which are transient structures that form in response to stress.  \n Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of FUS-opathies. \n Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-linked FUS/TLS alters stress granule assembly and dynamics. \n Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

Clomipramine likewise interacted with SERTs and NETs but also with several other receptors types, while citalopram and reboxetine were preferential ligands of SERTs and NETs, respectively.

        "question": "A Phase 2 Study of Concurrent Radiation Therapy, Temozolomide, and the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Valproic Acid for Patients With Glioblastoma. \n PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) cells to radiation in preclinical models. \n  Median overall survival (OS) was 29.6\u00a0months (range: 21-63.8\u00a0months), and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.5\u00a0months (range: 6.8-51.2\u00a0months). OS at 6, 12, and 24\u00a0months was 97%, 86%, and 56%, respectively. PFS at 6, 12, and 24\u00a0months was 70%, 43%, and 38% respectively.  \n CONCLUSIONS: Addition of VPA to concurrent RT/TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed GBM was well tolerated. Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study. \n Treatment of GDSCs with histone deacetylase inhibitors, TSA and VPA, significantly reduced proliferation rates of the cells and expression of the stem cell markers, indicating differentiation of the cells. Since differentiation into GBM makes them susceptible to the conventional cancer treatments, we posit that use of histone deacetylase inhibitors may increase efficacy of the conventional cancer treatments for eliminating GDSCs. \n Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients.  \n Our meta-analysis confirmed the benefit of using VPA (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44-0.71). Sub-group analysis shows that patients treated with VPA had a hazard ratio of 0.74 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.59-0.94 vs. patients treated by other-AEDs and a hazard ratio of 0.66 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.52-0.84 vs. patients treated by administration of non-AEDs.  \n .CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that glioblastoma patients may experience prolonged survival due to VPA administration.  \n A new and exciting insight is the potential contribution of VPA to prolonged survival, particularly in glioblastomas.  \n Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) cells to radiation in preclinical models \n Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival \n Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT) \n Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival. \n Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma. \n PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT). We investigated whether VA use during RT for GB was associated with overall survival (OS).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records of 544 adults with GB were retrospectively reviewed. Analyses were performed to determine the association of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG RPA) class, seizure history, and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) and AED use during RT with OS.RESULTS: Seizures before the end of RT were noted in 217 (40%) patients, and 403 (74%) were taking an AED during RT; 29 (7%) were taking VA.  \n When the analysis was restricted to patients who received concurrent TMZ, VA use was marginally associated with OS (P=.057; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, -0.09 to 1.17), independently of RTOG RPA class and seizure history. \n Patients using VPA in combination with temozolomide showed a longer median survival of 69 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61.7-67.3) compared with 61 weeks (95% CI: 52.5-69.5) in the group without VPA (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43-0.92; P = .016), adjusting for age, extent of resection, and O(6)-DNA methylguanine-methyltransferase promoter methylation status. \n Use of VPA together with chemoradiation with temozolomide results in a 2-months' longer survival of patients with GBM. \n Is valproic acid effective for glioblastoma treatment?",

In vivo, macitentan is metabolized into a major and pharmacologically active metabolite, ACT-132577.  \n Macitentan and its metabolite antagonized the specific binding of ET-1 on membranes of cells overexpressing ET(A) and ET(B) receptors and blunted ET-1-induced calcium mobilization in various natural cell lines, with inhibitory constants within the nanomolar range. In functional assays, macitentan and ACT-132577 inhibited ET-1-induced contractions in isolated endothelium-denuded rat aorta (ET(A) receptors) and sarafotoxin S6c-induced contractions in isolated rat trachea (ET(B) receptors). In rats with pulmonary hypertension, macitentan prevented both the increase of pulmonary pressure and the right ventricle hypertrophy, and it markedly improved survival.  \n In conclusion, macitentan, by its tissue-targeting properties and dual antagonism of ET receptors, protects against end-organ damage in diabetes and improves survival in pulmonary hypertensive rats. This profile makes macitentan a new agent to treat cardiovascular disorders associated with chronic tissue ET system activation. \n Pharmacology of macitentan, an orally active tissue-targeting dual endothelin receptor antagonist. \n Renal, retinal and cardiac changes in type 2 diabetes are attenuated by macitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist. \n Here we investigated the effects of macitentan, an orally-active, tissue-targeting dual ET receptor antagonist on chronic complications in type 2 diabetes.MAIN METHODS: db/db mice and their age- and sex-matched controls were examined after 2 and 4 months of diabetes.  \n Macitentan is a novel dual ETA/ETB receptor antagonist with enhanced tissue distribution and sustained receptor binding properties designed to achieve a more efficacious ET receptor blockade.  \n Recently oral prostacyclin receptor agonists have shown encouraging results. Many clinical studies targeting the vasoconstrictor ET-1 pathway with receptor antagonists like bosentan and ambrisentan have shown strong results, even more optimism coming from macitentan, the newest drug. \n Is macitentan an ET agonist?",

These results reveal the important role of SENP2 in the regulation of myostatin expression and myogenesis. \n Overexpression of c-Ski/SnoN also induces skeletal muscle differentiation, but how c-Ski/SnoN function in myogenesis is largely unknown. \n Notably, loss of sumoylation in the Lys-50 site (via a Lys-to-Arg point mutation) potently activates muscle-specific gene expression and enhances myotube formation. Our study suggests a novel role for SUMO modification in the regulation of myogenic differentiation. \n Although this modification has little effect on SnoN repression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter and only modestly potentiates SnoN repression of the p21 promoter, SnoN sumoylation robustly augments the ability of SnoN to suppress transcription of the myogenesis master regulatory gene myogenin \n Our study also points to a physiological role for SnoN sumoylation in the control of myogenin expression in differentiating muscle cells. \n Here, we biochemically characterize SnoN sumoylation in detail and report the physiological function of the modification.  \n An essential role of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific Protease 2 in myostatin expression and myogenesis. \n These results reveal the important role of SENP2 in the regulation of myostatin expression and myogenesis. \n The E3 SUMO ligase Nse2 regulates sumoylation and nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of skNAC-Smyd1 in myogenesis. \n Sumoylation of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor sharp-1 regulates recruitment of the histone methyltransferase G9a and function in myogenesis. \n  We show that the overall load of sumoylated proteins present in myoblasts diminishes progressively throughout myogenesis \n These novel results suggest that protein sumoylation plays a pivotal role in myoblast differentiation and is required to regulate the activity of key targets downstream of MyoD and myogenin. \n a composite sequence motif has recently been identified that couples phosphorylation, sumoylation, and perhaps also deacetylation to control transcriptional repression in stress response, mitogen and nuclear hormone signaling, myogenesis, and neuronal differentiation. \n Sumoylation of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor sharp-1 regulates recruitment of the histone methyltransferase G9a and function in myogenesis. \n Silencing SENP2 can reduce myostatin expression and, therefore, promote myogenesis of skeletal muscle. These results reveal the important role of SENP2 in the regulation of myostatin expression and myogenesis. \n Mutation of these SUMO acceptor sites in Sharp-1 does not impact its subcellular localization but attenuates its ability to act as a transcriptional repressor and inhibit myogenic differentiation. Consistently, co-expression of the SUMO protease SENP1 with wild type Sharp-1 abrogates Sharp-1-dependent inhibition of myogenesis.  \n Transforming growth factor-beta-independent regulation of myogenesis by SnoN sumoylation. \n Ubiquitin Specific Protease 25 (USP25), a member of the deubiquitinase family, is involved in several disease-related signal pathways including myogenesis, immunity and protein degradation.  \n  In addition, we show that the skNAC interaction partner Smyd1 contains a putative sumoylation motif and is sumoylated in muscle cells, with depletion of Mms21/Nse2 leading to reduced concentrations of sumoylated Smyd1. Taken together, our data suggest that the function, specifically the balance between the nuclear and cytosolic roles, of the skNAC-Smyd1 complex might be regulated by sumoylation. \n Is sumoylation implicated in myogenesis?",

        "question": "In Drosophila ovaries, the nuclear Piwi protein is required for transcriptional silencing of transposons, though the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. \n Here we show that the CG9754 protein is a component of Piwi complexes that functions downstream of Piwi and its binding partner, Asterix, in transcriptional silencing. Enforced tethering of CG9754 to nascent messenger RNA transcripts causes cotranscriptional silencing of the source locus and the deposition of repressive chromatin marks. \n We have named CG9754 \"Panoramix,\" and we propose that this protein could act as an adaptor, scaffolding interactions between the piRNA pathway and the general silencing machinery that it recruits to enforce transcriptional repression. \n piRNA-guided slicing of transposon transcripts enforces their transcriptional silencing via specifying the nuclear piRNA repertoire \n Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. \n To assess the dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. \n Thus, by reanimating RNAi, we uncovered a role for piRNAs in protecting essential genes from RNA silencing. \n In different organisms, small RNAs were shown to be implicated in the posttranscriptional degradation of mRNA and/or transcriptional repression of the homologous locus. In Drosophila, the mechanism of piRNA-mediated silencing is still far from being understood \n Analyses of piRNA-mediated transcriptional transposon silencing in Drosophila \n Transcriptional silencing implies a piRNA-mediated formation of repressive chromatin which diminishes the transcriptional capacity of the target locus. \n In mice, piRNA-guided transposon repression correlates with establishment of CpG DNA methylation on their sequences, yet the mechanism and the spectrum of genomic targets of piRNA silencing are unknown \n Using a candidate gene KD-approach, we identified differences in the spatio-temporal requirements of the piRNA pathway components for piRNA-mediated silencing. \n Spatio-temporal requirements for transposable element piRNA-mediated silencing during Drosophila oogenesis \n In contrast, piRNA-mediated silencing is strong in germline stem cells in which TE mobilization is tightly repressed ensuring the continued production of viable germline cysts. \n Piwi induces piRNA-guided transcriptional silencing and establishment of a repressive chromatin state. \n In germ cells, early embryos, and stem cells of animals, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have an important role in silencing retrotransposons, which are vicious genomic parasites, through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. \n Our results show that the piRNA pathway can be used as a tool for sequence-specific gene silencing in germ cells and support the idea that the piRNA generating regions serve as traps for retrotransposons, enabling the host cell to generate piRNAs against active retrotransposons. \n  Our observations confirm the pivotal role of piRNA-mediated silencing in defending the genome against selfish transposition, yet also suggest limits to the optimization of host genome defense. \n Analysis of piRNA-mediated silencing of active TEs in Drosophila melanogaster suggests limits on the evolution of host genome defense \n The Piwi-interacting

but also on their intriguing relationship with cellular genes that have been shown to be important for gametogenesis and fertility. \n The most abundant piRNAs were those corresponding to antisense transcripts of Suppressor of Stellate [Su(Ste)] genes known to be involved in Stellate gene silencing \n To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in gene regulation \n PIWI-interacting small non-coding RNAs (piRNAs) are genetic and epigenetic regulatory factors in germline cells, where they maintain genome stability, are involved in RNA silencing and regulate gene expression \n The piNG-body contains ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in piRNA-silencing of genome repeats including transposons in premeiotic spermatocytes with aid of short piRNAs \n Our results show that the piRNA pathway can be used as a tool for sequence-specific gene silencing in germ cells and support the idea that the piRNA generating regions serve as traps for retrotransposons, enabling the host cell to generate piRNAs against active retrotransposons \n Recent studies have revealed not only the biogenesis of piRNAs and their roles in transposon silencing, but also the function of the Piwi-piRNA pathway in epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression \n A growing number of studies on piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA biogenesis \n These have shed light not

We identified 98 elements \u226580 bp long with very high conservation across the Drosophila phylogeny. Population genetic analyses reveal that these UCEs are not present in mutational cold spots. Instead we infer that they experience a level of selective constraint almost 10-fold higher compared with missense mutations in protein-coding sequences, which is substantially higher than that observed previously for human UCEs. About one-half of these Drosophila UCEs overlap the transcribed portion of genes, with many of those that are within coding sequences likely to correspond to sites of ADAR-dependent RNA editing. For the remaining UCEs that are in nongenic regions, we find that many are potentially capable of forming RNA secondary structures. Among ten chosen for further analysis, we discovered that the majority are transcribed in multiple tissues of Drosophila melanogaster.

        "question": "SGs have been linked to several pathologies including inflammatory diseases, cancer, viral infection, and neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). \n Like several other ALS-associated proteins, CREST is recruited to induced stress granules. \n Our data indicate that CREST and certain other ALS-linked proteins share several features implicated in ALS pathogenesis, namely the ability to aggregate, be recruited to stress granules and alter paraspeckle integrity. \n A unifying feature of many proteins associated with ALS, including TDP-43 and ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules.  \n Two RNA-binding proteins, TDP-43 and FUS, aggregate in the degenerating motor neurons of ALS patients, and mutations in the genes encoding these proteins cause some forms of ALS. \n Recent work connecting TDP-43 and FUS to stress granules has suggested how this cellular pathway, which involves protein aggregation as part of its normal function, might be coopted during disease pathogenesis. \n Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress. Since only the mutants, but not the endogenous wild-type FUS, are associated with stress granules under most of the stress conditions reported to date, the relationship between FUS and stress granules represents a mutant-specific phenotype and thus may be of significance in mutant-induced pathogenesis. \n Fused in sarcoma (FUS) belongs to the group of RNA-binding proteins implicated as underlying factors in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and certain other neurodegenerative diseases. Multiple FUS gene mutations have been linked to hereditary forms, and aggregation of FUS protein is believed to play an important role in pathogenesis of these diseases. In cultured cells, FUS variants with disease-associated amino acid substitutions or short deletions affecting nuclear localization signal (NLS) and causing cytoplasmic mislocalization can be sequestered into stress granules (SGs). \n Profilin 1 associates with stress granules and ALS-linked mutations alter stress granule dynamics \n Here we report that profilin 1 and related protein profilin 2 are novel stress granule-associated proteins in mouse primary cortical neurons and in human cell lines and that ALS-linked mutations in profilin 1 alter stress granule dynamics, providing further evidence for the potential role of stress granules in ALS pathogenesis \n Furthermore, in response to oxidative stress or heat shock conditions in cultures and in vivo, the ALS-linked FUS mutants, but not wild-type FUS, assembled into perinuclear stress granules in proportion to their cytoplasmic expression levels. \n Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules. \n Our results suggest that the ALS mutations in FUS NLS can impair FUS nuclear localization, induce cytoplasmic inclusions and stress granules, and potentially perturb RNA metabolism. \n RNA-binding ability of FUS regulates neurodegeneration, cytoplasmic mislocalization and incorporation into stress granules associated with FUS carrying ALS-linked mutations. \n TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that is known to regulate the splicing, transport, and storage of specific mRNAs into stress granules \n In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) accumulates in the cytoplasm of affected neurons and glia, where it associates with stress granules (SGs) and forms large inclusions \n Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma (FUS/TLS or FUS) is concentrated within cytoplasmic stress granules under conditions of induced stress \n Mutant FUS proteins that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis incorporate into stress granules \n Mutations in Fus cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the mutant protein forms inclusions that appear to correspond to stress granules \n Recent work also suggests that TDP-43 associates with cytoplasmic stress granules, which are transient structures that form in response to stress.  \n We found that in response to oxidative stress and to environmental insults of different types TDP-43 is capable to assemble into stress granules (SGs), ribonucleoprotein complexes where protein synthesis is temporarily arrested.  \n A unifying feature of many proteins associated with ALS, including TDP-43 and ataxin-2, is that they localize to stress granules.  \n Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases. We propose that two pathological hits, namely nuclear import defects and cellular stress, are involved in the pathogenesis of FUS-opathies. \n Moreover, proteins known to be stress granule markers co-deposit with inclusions in fALS and FTLD-FUS patients, implicating stress granule formation in the pathogenesis of these diseases.

in mitochondrial translation \n Novel C12orf65 mutations in patients with axonal neuropathy and optic atrophy. \n Our study broadens the phenotypic spectrum of C12orf65 defects and highlights the

with a spectrum of phenotypes, including early onset optic atrophy, progressive encephalomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and spastic paraparesis.We used whole-genome homozygosity mapping as well as

Our studies provide compelling evidence that mammalian Pol II acts as an RdRP to control the stability of a cellular RNA by extending its 3'-end. \n here is, however, evidence that Pol II also possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Pol II can use a homopolymeric RNA template, can extend RNA by several nucleotides in the absence of DNA, and has been implicated in the replication of the RNA genomes of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and plant viroids. \n The RdRP activity of Pol II provides a missing link in molecular evolution, because it suggests that Pol II evolved from an ancient replicase that duplicated RNA genomes. \n The present findings provide a framework for further studies to elucidate the mechanistic principles of transcription by a viral RNA polymerase and have implications for the regulation of Pol II activities in infected cells. \n Influenza A virus transcribes its segmented negative sense RNA genome in the nuclei of infected cells in a process long known to require host RNA polymerase II (RNAP-II). \n We conclude that influenza A virus replication requires RNAP-II activity not just to provide capped mRNA substrates but also to facilitate nuclear export of selected viral mRNAs. \n Thus, influenza virus specifically interferes with Pol II elongation, but not Pol II initiation. We propose that influenza virus RNA polymerase, by binding to the CTD of initiating Pol II and subsequent cleavage of the capped 5' end of the nascent transcript, triggers premature Pol II termination. \n We show that RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) preinitiation complex recruitment and H3 Lys 4 (H3-K4) methylation at the Xist promoter form the basis of the Xist expression profiles that drives both imprinted and random XCI. \n Identification of these ENL-associated proteins (EAPs) by mass spectrometry revealed enzymes with a known role in transcriptional elongation (RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase [RNAPolII CTD] positive transcription elongation factor b [pTEFb]), and in chromatin modification (histone-H3 methyltransferase DOT1L) as well as other frequent MLL partners (AF4, AF5q31, and LAF4), and polycomb group members (RING1, CBX8, and BCoR). \n We show that RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) preinitiation complex recruitment and H3 Lys 4 (H3-K4) methylation at the Xist promoter form the basis of the Xist expression profiles that drives both imprinted and random XCI. \n Identification of these ENL-associated proteins (EAPs) by mass spectrometry revealed enzymes with a known role in transcriptional elongation (RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase [RNAPolII CTD] positive transcription elongation factor b [pTEFb]), and in chromatin modification (histone-H3 methyltransferase DOT1L) as well as other frequent MLL partners (AF4, AF5q31, and LAF4), and polycomb group members (RING1, CBX8, and BCoR). \n RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA. \n RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA. \n RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA. \n RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA. \n Association of the influenza A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with cellular RNA polymerase II. \n It is also well established that viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRNP) associates with cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II), on which viral replication depends.  \n RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA. \n RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a well-characterized DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has also been reported to have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity.

Subsequently, cytochrome c was released from mitochondria to cytosol. \n associated with translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation.  \n Once activated, BAK and BAX form proteolipid pores in the OMM leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), and the release of inner membrane space proteins, such as cytochrome c, which promotes caspase activation.  \n  Our results showed that OC induced a caspase-dependent apoptosis by triggering a series of events in HeLa cells including Bax translocation, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activation, chromosome fragmentation followed by caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage and eventually cell death.  \n Bax plays a key role in intrinsic apoptotic signaling in neurons by allowing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c.  \n Can the apoptosis regulator BAX trigger the release of cytochrome c?",

        "question": "Here we observe that mutation rate, as reflected in recent evolutionary divergence and human nucleotide diversity, is markedly increased in later-replicating regions of the human genome \n ll classes of substitutions are affected, suggesting a generalized mechanism involving replication time-dependent DNA damage \n We show that mutation rate varies 6-fold across a single chromosome, that this variation is correlated with replication timing, and we propose a model to explain this variation that relies on the temporal separation of two processes for replicating past damaged DNA: error-free DNA damage tolerance and translesion synthesis. \n Recent studies revealed a long suspected replication-timing effect on mutation rate, but the mechanisms that regulate the increase in mutation rate as the genome is replicated remain unclear.  \n DNA repair systems, in general, are less efficient in late replicating heterochromatic regions compared to early replicating euchromatic regions of the genome. \n The mutational profile of the yeast genome is shaped by replication \n the mutation rate increases with the replication timing by more than 30% between the earliest and the latest replicating regions. \n Thus, we show that the leading replicating strands present an excess of C over G and of A over T in the genome of S. cerevisiae (reciprocally an excess of G + T over C + A in lagging strands) \n Late-replicating domains have higher divergence and diversity in Drosophila melanogaster \n Recent evidence also suggests that late replication is associated with high mutability in yeast. \n Limited evidence from one chromosome arm in Drosophila melanogaster suggests the opposite pattern, with regions overlapping early-firing origins showing increased levels of diversity and divergence \n The mutation rate for DNA mismatch repair null strains was approximately 1 mutation per genome per generation, 225-fold greater than the wild-type rate. The mutations were distributed randomly throughout the genome, independent of replication timing. \n Many single-nucleotide substitutions in cancer genomes arise because of errors in DNA replication, which is spatio-temporally stratified. \n Here we propose that DNA replication patterns help shape the mutational landscapes of normal and cancer genomes \n Using data on five fully sequenced cancer types and two personal genomes, we determined that the frequency of intergenic single-nucleotide substitution is significantly higher in late DNA replication timing regions, even after controlling for a number of genomic features \n we found that genomic regions in close spatial proximity to late-replicating domains display similar mutation spectra as the late-replicating regions themselves \n In addition, certain chromosome rearrangements found in cancer cells and in cells exposed to ionizing radiation display a significant delay in replication timing of >3 hours that affects the entire chromosome(2,3). Recent work from our lab indicates that disruption of discrete cis-acting autosomal loci result in an extremely late replicating phenotype that affects the entire chromosome(4). \n A conservative estimate is that at least 1-2% of new deleterious mutations affect some aspect of DNA replication, repair, or chromosome segregation. Since deleterious mutations can have an effect even as heterozygotes, this mutation accumulation can create an inherited background of late-acting mutations that themselves enhance mutation rate. \n Drake calculates that lytic RNA viruses display spontaneous mutation rates of approximately one per genome while most have mutation rates that are approximately 0.1 per genome (Drake 1993). This constancy of germline mutation rates among microbial species need not necessarily mean constancy of the somatic mutation rates. \n A recent flurry of reports correlates replication timing (RT) with mutation rates during both evolution and cancer. \n DNA replication timing, genome stability and cancer: late and/or delayed DNA replication timing is associated with increased genomic instability. \n A recent flurry of reports correlates replication timing (RT) with mutation rates during both evolution and cancer. \n Since deleterious mutations can have an effect even as heterozygotes, this mutation accumulation can create an inherited background of late-acting mutations that themselves enhance mutation rate. \n A recent flurry of reports correlates replication timing (RT) with mutation rates during both evolution and cancer. \n DNA replication timing, genome stability and cancer: late and/or delayed DNA replication timing is associated with increased genomic instability. \n In addition, this method allows for the unambiguous identification of chromosomal rearrangements that correlate with changes in replication timing that affect the entire chromosome. \n Does replication timing affect the rate of somatic mutations?",

        "question": "Vortioxetine is the most recently approved medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).  \n [Vortioxetine: a new antidepressant to treat depressive episodes]. \n Vortioxetine is a new antidepressant, which mechanism of action is multimodal, targeting the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT3, 5-HT7\u00a0receptors and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT).  \n In short-term studies (8\u00a0weeks), vortioxetine is more efficacious than placebo in decreasing depressive symptoms as measured by the MADRS total score, response rate (vortioxetine: 53.2% vs placebo: 35.2%) and remission rate (vortioxetine: 29.2% vs placebo: 19.3%). In a long-term study (52\u00a0weeks), vortioxetine is also superior to placebo in preventing relapses and recurrences. Moreover, in second line treatment, after failure of a first line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin norepinephrin reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), vortioxetine is superior to agomelatine in improving depressive symptoms and achieving response and remission.  \n Against this background, we feature the novel antidepressants vortioxetine, vilazodone and milnacipran/levomilnacipran with regard to their serotonin receptor targets such as the 5-HT1A, 5-HT3 and 5-HT7 which may account for their specific effects on certain symptoms of depression (e.g. cognition and anxiety) as well as a characteristic side-effect profile. \n CONCLUSION: Vortioxetine dominated venlafaxine XR in South Korea and is a relevant treatment option for MDD patients initiating or switching therapy. \n Vortioxetine: a New Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder. \n INTRODUCTION: Vortioxetine is a structurally novel medication that has recently been approved for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). \n EXPERT OPINION: Results of placebo-controlled trials suggest efficacy and an overall safety profile comparable to existing first-line antidepressants.  \n The authors suggest that vortioxetine is currently a good second-line antidepressant option and shows promise, pending additional long-term data, to become a first-line antidepressant option. \n Clinical studies indicate that vortioxetine is effective in the treatment of major depression, though there is no suggestion of superiority over active comparators. \n Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day. \n Vortioxetine was significantly more effective than was placebo, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of\u00a0-0.118 (95% CIs,\u00a0-0.203 to\u00a0-0.033, P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). \n Vortioxetine for the treatment of

is being investigated by Lundbeck and Takeda for the treatment of major depression and generalized anxiety disorders. \n Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is a multi-modal antidepressant in clinical development for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). \n A randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine 2.5 and 10\u2009mg in acute treatment of adults with generalized anxiety disorder. \n Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day. \n Secondary endpoints included response and remission rates, anxiety symptoms(Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), Clinical Global Impression, overall functioning (Sheehan Disability Scale), health-related quality of life(EuroQol 5 Dimensions), productivity (work limitation questionnaire) and family functioning (Depression and Family Functioning Scale).RESULTS: Primary endpoint noninferiority was established and vortioxetine (n = 252) was superior to agomelatine (n = 241) by 2.2 MADRS points (p<0.01). \n Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is an antidepressant with a mechanism of action thought to be related to a combination of 2 pharmacologic actions: direct modulation of several receptors and inhibition of the serotonin transporter.To evaluate the efficacy of vortioxetine 10 and 20 mg once daily in outpatients with major depressive disorder.This 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted from July 2010 to January 2012 among adults with a primary diagnosis of recurrent major depressive disorder (DSM-IV-TR).Eligible subjects were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms: vortioxetine 10 mg, vortioxetine 20 mg, or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. \n Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is a new antidepressant that combines a number of neurotransmitter reuptake and receptor effects that have been thought to predict efficacy as a treatment for depressive and anxiety disorders.This review summarizes the pharmacology and neurobiology of vortioxetine \n In the study of elderly patients, vortioxetine 5 mg (n = 136) improved 12-item Health Status Questionnaire scores significantly more than placebo (n = 148) for the domains of health perception (10.4, P &lt; 0.0001, SES of 0.54), mental health (7.9, P &lt; 0.001, SES of 0.44), and energy (6.4, P &lt; 0.05, SES of 0.28) (FAS, mixed model for repeated measures).Vortioxetine yielded significant, meaningful HRQoL improvements in 6 MDD studies of 6 to 8 weeks duration. \n All references included were published between 1999 and 2014.All studies that included humans and were published in English, with data describing vortioxetine for the treatment of MDD, were reviewed.Vortioxetine is a novel multimodal antidepressant agent, which inhibits the 5-HT transporter protein, acts as a 5-HT3 antagonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, and a partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor \n Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day \n Vortioxetine is an antidepressant with multimodal activity which has shown efficacy in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients in six of ten short-term, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (completed end 2012).We performed meta-regression analyses to indirectly compare vortioxetine to seven marketed antidepressants with different mechanisms of action \n Data were available from 51 human trials involving vortioxetine, and included a total of 7,666 healthy volunteers and patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or generalized anxiety disorder who were exposed to at least 1 dose of vortioxetine for a total of 2,743 patient-years.Vortioxetine was effective in treating MDD in the United States at a dose of 20 mg/d \n Vortioxetine is a recently approved multimodal antidepressant with anxiolytic properties in preclinical studies.This double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine in subjects with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder.Subjects (n\u2009=\u2009457) were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with placebo or vortioxetine 2.5 or 10\u2009mg once daily \n There was a significant difference for nausea between the two groups (OR=3.01, 95 % CI=2.22-4.09, Z=7.08, P=0.00001), but no significant differences were observed for the other four adverse effects.CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of major depressive disorder, our results show that a

the treatment of major depression, though there is no suggestion of superiority over active comparators. \n The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was significantly higher in the duloxetine group than in the vortioxetine group.Duloxetine was more effective but less well-tolerated than vortioxetine in MDD. \n There was no significant difference in discontinuation rates between vortioxetine and comparators owing to inefficacy (OR 0.983, 95% CI 0.585 to 1.650), whereas discontinuation owing to AEs was significantly less common in the vortioxetine than in the comparator group (OR 0.728, 95% CI 0.554 to 0.957).Studies examining the role of vortioxetine in the treatment of MDD are limited.Although our results suggest that vortioxetine may be an effective treatment option for MDD, they should be interpreted and translated into clinical practice with caution, as the meta-analysis was based on a l \n We performed a meta-analysis to increase the statistical power of these studies and enhance our current understanding of the role of vortioxetine in the treatment of MDD.We performed an extensive search of databases and the clinical trial registry. \n BACKGROUND: Vortioxetine is a recently approved multimodal antidepressant with anxiolytic properties in preclinical studies.OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine in subjects with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder.METHODS: Subjects (n\u2009=\u2009457) were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with placebo or vortioxetine 2.5 or 10\u2009mg once daily. \n Vortioxetine significantly improved objective and subjective measures of cognitive function in adults with recurrent MDD and these effects were largely independent of its effect on improving depressive symptoms. \n Furthermore, a statistically significant number of patients with MDD who were on vortioxetine have achieved a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in depression symptoms from baseline. \n BACKGROUND: Vortioxetine is a novel multimodal compound that has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). \n Although our results suggest that vortioxetine may be an effective treatment option for MDD, they should be interpreted and translated into clinical practice with caution, as the meta-analysis was

        "question": "RESULTS: Forty-four with a positive FGFR3 mutation, median age 9 years, range 7 months to 52 years were enrolled. In addition, 10 unaffected siblings served as controls (5 males, 5 females; median age, 13 years; range, 3-18 years). \n Muenke is a fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3)-associated syndrome, which was first described in late 1990 s.  \n The syndrome is defined molecularly by a unique point mutation c.749C>G in exon 7 of the FGFR3 gene which results to an amino acid substitution p.Pro250Arg of the protein product.  \n Muenke syndrome caused by point mutation (C749G) in the FGFR3 gene affects 1 in 30,000 newborns and accounts for 25% to 30% of genetic causes of craniosynostosis. \n Phenotypic variability in two families of Muenke syndrome with FGFR3 mutation. \n PURPOSE: There are a number of craniosynostosis syndromes with hearing loss-including Muenke, Apert, Pfeiffer, Crouzon, Beare-Stevenson, Crouzon with acanthosis nigricans, and Jackson-Weiss syndromes-that result from mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes.  \n Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome resulting from a defining point mutation in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor3 (FGFR3) gene. \n Talocalcaneal coalition in Muenke syndrome: report of a patient, review of the literature in FGFR-related craniosynostoses, and consideration of mechanism. \n To better understand the pathophysiology of the Muenke syndrome, we present collective findings from several recent studies that have characterized a genetically equivalent mouse model for Muenke syndrome (FgfR3 (P244R)) and compare them with human phenotypes. \n We show in this study that knock-in mice harboring the mutation responsible for the Muenke syndrome (FgfR3(P244R)) display postnatal shortening of the cranial base along with synchondrosis growth plate dysfunction characterized by loss of resting, proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocyte zones and decreased Ihh expression. \n Muenke syndrome is caused by a single defining point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. \n The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes. \n Epilepsy in Muenke syndrome: FGFR3-related craniosynostosis. \n Muenke syndrome (FGFR3-related craniosynostosis): expansion of the phenotype and review of the literature. \n The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes. \n PURPOSE: The Muenke syndrome mutation (FGFR3 (P250R)), which was discovered 15 years ago, represents the single most common craniosynostosis mutation. \n The heterozygous Pro250Arg substitution mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), which increases ligand-dependent signalling, is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans and defines Muenke syndrome. \n P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene also known as Muenke syndrome is associated with coronal craniosynostosis, sensorineural deafness, craniofacial, and digital abnormalities. \n Muenke syndrome caused by the FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation is associated with craniosynostosis, hearing loss, and various bony anomalies. \n Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene. \n Muenke syndrome, defined by heterozygosity for a Pro250Arg substitution in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans. \n In addition, sensorineural hearing loss is detected in all FgfR3 (P244R) mutant mice as in the majority of Muenke syndrome patients. \n Genetic testing identifies a pathogenic mutation or chromosomal abnormality in \u223c 21% of cases, but it is likely that further causative mutations remain to be discovered.To identify a shared signature of genetically determined craniosynostosis by comparing the expression patterns in three monogenic syndromes with a control group of patients with non-syndromic sagittal synostosis.Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2 substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no mutation detected) were cultured \n The craniosynostosis syndromes: Apert syndrome, Beare-Stevenson syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Muenke syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome and Saethre-Chotzen syndrome can be caused by mutation in either FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 \n Identical proline-->arginine gain-of-function mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1 (Pro252Arg), FGFR2 (Pro253Arg) and FGFR3 (Pro250Arg), result in type I Pfeiffer, Apert and Muenke craniosynostosis syndromes, respectively \n The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes \n Mutation analysis of FGFR-3 revealed a missense mutation in exon 6, c.749 C>G, with a resultant amino acid change from proline to arginine at codon 250 (P250R), in keeping with Muenke syndrome (Am J Hum Genet 1997;60:555-564) \n In an attempt to delineate functional features separating SCS from Muenkes syndrome, we screened patients presenting with coronal suture synostosis for mutations in the TWIST 1 gene, and for the Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3 \n Since the Gly380Arg achondroplasia mutation was recognized, similar observations regarding the conserved nature of FGFR mutations and resulting phenotype have been made regarding other skeletal phenotypes, including hypochondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and Muenke coronal craniosynostosis \n Mutations in the gene that encodes Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) are associated with Achondroplasia (MIM 100800), Hypochondroplasia (MIM 146000), Muenke Syndrome (MIM 602849), Thanatophoric Dysplasia (MIM 187600, MIM 187601) and Lacrimo-Auriculo-Dento-Digital Syndrome (MIM 149730).Here we report a clinical and molecular study in a large cohort of 125 Portuguese patients with these skeletal disorders.  \n The Muenke syndrome (MS) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene.  \n P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene also known as Muenke syndrome is associated with coronal craniosynostosis, sensorineural deafness, craniofacial, and digital abnormalities.  \n METHODS: Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2 substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no mutation detected) were cultured.  \n Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene.  \n Muenke syndrome, also known as FGFR3-associated coronal synostosis, is defined molecularly by the presence of a heterozygous nucleotide transversion, c.749C>G, encoding the amino acid substitution Pro250Arg, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 gene (FGFR3).  \n In spite of a variable phenotype, Muenke syndrome has been related to a unique mutation on the FGFR3 gene, Pro 250 to Arg, which is characteristic of this disease.  \n Skeletal analysis of the Fgfr3(P244R) mouse, a genetic model for the Muenke craniosynostosis syndrome. \n Muenke syndrome is caused by a single defining point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene.

Consequently, it is an important drug target for the two most virulent malaria parasites of humans, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. \n Plasmepsin V (PmV) is an essential Plasmodium protease and a highly promising antimalarial target, which still lacks molecular characterization and drug-like inhibitors. \n Our inhibitors act 'on-target', confirmed by cellular interference of PmV function and biochemical interaction with inhibitors.  \n Our work disclosed novel pursuable drug design strategies for highly efficient PmV inhibition highlighting novel molecular elements necessary for picomolar activity against PmV. All the presented data are discussed in respect to human aspartic proteases and previously reported inhibitors, highlighting differences and proposing new strategies for drug development. \n High binding likeness on antimalarial target plasmepsin was detected through molecular docking.  \n This provides the first direct evidence that PMV activity is essential for protein export in Plasmodium spp. and for parasite survival in human erythrocytes and validates PMV as an antimalarial drug target. \n The export mechanism involves the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL), which is a cleavage site for the parasite protease, Plasmepsin V (PMV).  \n Plasmepsin II (PM II) is an attractive target for anti-malaria drug discovery, which involves in host hemoglobin degradation in the acidic food vacuole. \n These methods are utilized to search for inhibitors of the aspartyl proteases, plasmepsin II and cathepsin D. Plasmepsin II, a protease found in the malaria parasite, hydrolyzes human hemoglobin, the nutrient source for the parasite and is a new target for anti-malaria therapy. \n Given recent advances in understanding the fundamental roles of the various plasmepsins, it is likely that the most effective antimalarial plasmepsin targets will be the non-digestive vacuole plasmepsins. \n Plasmepsins (PMs) are essential proteases of the plasmodia parasites and are therefore promising targets for developing drugs against malaria. \n Therefore, the plasmepsins of malaria parasites have been recognized as attractive antimalarial drug targets. \n As inhibition of plasmepsins leads to the parasite's death, these enzymes can be utilized as potential drug targets. \n falciparum plasmepsins II and IV make structure-based drug design of antimalarial compounds that focus on inhibiting plasmepsins possible. \n The malarial parasite encodes two homologous aspartic proteases, plasmepsins I and II, which are essential components of its hemoglobin-degradation pathway and are novel targets for antimalarial drug development. \n vivax plasmepsins (PvPMs) from different geographical regions are of utmost importance for drugs and vaccine designs for anti-malarial strategies. \n In P.falciparum, plasmepsins I, II, IV and HAP have been directly implicated in hemoglobin degradation during malaria infection, and are now considered targets for anti-malarial drug design. \n These results shed light on the role of V105 and T108 residues in plasmepsin specificities, and they should be useful in structure-based design of novel, selective inhibitors that may serve as antimalarial drugs. \n The aspartic proteases plasmepsins, whose inhibition leads to parasite death, are classified as targets for the design of potent drugs. \n A large compound library of about 1 million chemical compounds was docked on 5 different targets of plasmepsins using two different docking software, namely FlexX and AutoDock. \n Plasmodium aspartic proteases known as plasmepsins play an important role on haemoglobin degradation and are being studied as drug targets for chemotherapy of malaria. \n Our study revealed about 100 parasite-coded gene products that included many known drug targets such as Pf hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, Pf L-lactate dehydrogenase, and Plasmepsins. \n The two aspartic proteases, plasmepsins I and II, from Plasmodium falciparum have recently emerged as potential targets. \n Plasmepsins are highly promising as drug targets, especially when combined with the inhibition of falcipains that are also involved in hemoglobin catabolism. \n Among such enzymes, Plasmepsins (aspartic proteases) and, especially, Falcipains (cysteine proteases) are highly promising antimalarial drug targets. \n The high sequence conservations between the plasmepsins from the isolates support the notion that the enzymes could be reliable targets for new antimalarial chemotherapeutics. \n Due to early crystallographic evidence, plasmepsin II (Plm II) emerged as well explored target to develop novel antimalarials as well as a starting point to develop inhibitors targeting some other subtypes of plasmepsins i.e. \n Plasmepsin, an aspartic protease, which is involved in the hemoglobin breakdown into smaller peptides emerged as a crucial target to develop new chemical entities to counter malaria. \n were employed in order to develop new chemical entities targeting Plm II. \n With the advancements in drug discovery, several computational and synthetic approaches were employed in order to develop novel inhibitors targeting Plm II. \n vivax plasmepsins (PvPMs) from different geographical regions are of utmost importance for drugs and vaccine designs for anti-malarial strategies.. \n We developed a potent inhibitor of plasmepsin V, called WEHI-842, which directly mimics the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL). \n In order to validate appropriate use of PM4 as potential anti-malarial drug target, studies on genetic and structural variations among P. \n Over the past decade, much effort has been placed towards developing plasmepsin inhibitors as antimalarial agents, particularly targeting the digestive vacuole. \n Could plasmepsins be used as targets for developing anti-malaria drugs?",

        "question": "Ang II treatment also led to a significant increment in intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, which could be fully abolished by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium, indicating that Ang II enhanced oxidative stress via a NADPH oxidase-dependent manner. \n NOX inhibitors (diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or apocynin) were able to achieve similar results to that of ML-7 except no effect on MLCK activity and MLC20 phosphorylation.  \n Significant reductions of AII effects on podocyte TRPC6 were also observed after pretreatment with NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium (DPI).  \n Furthermore, inhibition of NOX-mediated ROS production with apocynin, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or NOX2 docking sequence (Nox2ds)-tat peptide during these first 4h of PE stimulation significantly inhibited PE-induced hypertrophy of H9c2 cells, both after 24 and 48h of PE stimulation.  \n Remarkably, Ang-II induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) via a NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent mechanism, as shown by inhibition of ROS production via the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin.  \n Moreover, NADPH oxidase activation by beta CD (145.5+/-9.0%; control: 98.6+/-1.6%) was also abrogated by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin (100.4+/-3.2%) and diphenylene iodonium (9.5+/-3.3%). \n We used structurally diverse NADPH oxidase inhibitors, aminoethyl-benzenesulfonylfluoride (AEBSF, 100-1000microM), apocynin (100-1000microM), and diphenylene iodonium (DPI, 3-30microM), to inhibit intrinsic NADPH oxidase activity in N27 cells. \n Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol. \n With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium. \n The contractile responses to U46619 in isolated PA were inhibited by PEG-catalase and the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin. \n The effects of diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, on key parameters of PSC activation were evaluated in vitro. \n These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oA\u00e2. \n Diphenylene iodonium is an inhibitor of the respiratory burst-generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes. \n NADPH oxidase inhibitors [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-acetophenone)] prevented the microglial activation induced by oA\u00e2, suggesting that NADPH oxidase activation was involved in microglial activation. \n In addition,

[N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)] or transfection with siRNAs of MyD88, PKCalpha, Src, p47(phox), p300, and HDAC4. \n Here we show that cAMP-dependent decidualization can be attenuated or enhanced upon treatment of primary cultures with a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor (diphenylen iodonium) or activator (apocynin), respectively.  \n With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium.  \n The inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, and of the mitochondrial electron transport system at complex II by thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), significantly inhibited both AGE-induced ROS production and VCAM-1 expression, whereas these effects were potentiated by rotenone and antimycin A, specific inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I and III, respectively.  \n Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol.  \n Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects.  \n The G6PD inhibitor DHEA and the inhibitors of NADPH oxidase apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI) prevented both superoxide generation and capacitation in human spermatozoa, but whereas DPI and DHEA inhibited PPP, apocynin did not influence it, suggesting that PPP activation during capacitation is not a response to increased oxidative stress but exerts a role by supplying reducing equivalents to oxygen. \n Ang II induced a time-dependent increase in Rac1 activation and O(2)(*-) production in Neuro-2A cells, and this was abolished by pretreatment with AdN17Rac1 or the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or

prevented the microglial activation induced by oA\u03b2, suggesting that NADPH oxidase activation was involved in microglial activation. \n Furthermore, inhibition of NOX-mediated ROS production with apocynin, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or NOX2 docking sequence (Nox2ds)-tat peptide during these first 4h of PE stimulation significantly inhibited PE-induced hypertrophy of H9c2 cells, both after 24 and 48h of PE stimulation. \n We compared the pharmacological profiles of the commonly used NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin and 4-(2-amino-ethyl)-benzolsulphonyl-fluoride (AEBSF), as well as the novel triazolo pyrimidine VAS3947. \n IL-1beta and TNF-alpha rapidly stimulated the rate of hydrogen peroxide produced by isolated microglia, and this was inhibited by diphenylene iodonium, implying that the cytokines were acting directly on microglia to stimulate the NADPH oxidase. \n The fractions achieved the same effects that known NADPH oxidase inhibitors, such as diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, but they presented better hydrosolubility. \n Ang II induced a time-dependent increase in Rac1 activation and O(2)(*-) production in Neuro-2A cells, and this was abolished by pretreatment with AdN17Rac1 or the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium. \n Can NADPH oxidase be inhibited by apocynin and

        "question": "A unique organelle for studying membrane biochemistry is the mitochondrion whose functionality depends on a coordinated supply of proteins and lipids. Mitochondria are capable of synthesizing several lipids autonomously such as phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin and in part phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid and CDP-diacylglycerol. \n A small decrease of diphosphatidylglycerol also occurred in the hepatoma mitochondria inner membrane.  \n Diphosphatidylglycerol was confined to the mitochondrial fraction, where it represented about 7% of the total phosphoacylglycerols.  \n Mitochondrial membranes were isolated from the myocardium of young (4-month-old) and aged (33-month-old) male Long-Evans rats and compared in terms of cholesterol content and phospholipid and fatty acid composition. In aged rats, as compared to young, the major observations include: markedly higher cholesterol content; increased percentage of sphingomyelin and diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin);  \n The polyglycerophosphatides (typified by diphosphatidylglycerol) were apparently synthesized in situ by intramitochondrial membrane-bound enzymes using CDP-diglycerides as intermediates.  \n Both the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions contained significant proportions of solvent front phospholipid (SFP) and whereas the mitochondrial SFP displayed the relatively unsaturated fatty acid composition characteristic of diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin), the fatty acids of the microsomal SFP were distinctly more saturated. \n Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). \n The enzyme responsible for the conversion of phosphatidylglycerol to diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) in the presence of cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol is firmly associated with mitochondrial membranes and is not extracted with hypotonic or hypertonic media or with nonionic detergents. \n The mechanism of cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) biosynthesis was examined in mitochondria and outer and inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea pig and rat livers to determine whether this formation from phosphatidylglycerol was absolutely dependent on cytidinediphosphodiglyceride, as previously reported for intact mitochondria. \n In isolated mitochondrial outer membranes, cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) increased CPT1 activity 4-fold and the Km for carnitine 6-fold. \n Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). \n 90% or more of the phospholipid, cardiolipin was found in the mitochondrial membranes of wild type and petite yeast. \n Furthermore, the same mechanism for the biosynthesis of cardiolipin was operational in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. \n The mechanism of cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) biosynthesis was examined in mitochondria and outer and inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea pig and rat livers to determine whether this formation from phosphatidylglycerol was absolutely dependent on cytidinediphosphodiglyceride, as previously reported for intact mitochondria \n Cardiolipin (CL) is a key phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes, playing important roles in maintaining the functional integrity and dynamics of mitochondria in animals and yeasts \n Cardiolipin, the specific phospholipid of mitochondria, is involved in the biogenesis, the dynamics, and the supramolecular organization of mitochondrial membranes \n Cardiolipin (CL), the signature phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes, is crucial for both mitochondrial function and cellular processes outside of the mitochondria \n Since it has been recognized that mitochondria are crucial not only for energy metabolism but also for other cellular functions, there has been a growing interest in cardiolipin, the specific phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes \n Cardiolipin, the main anionic phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes, is expected to be a determinant in this adaptive mechanism since it modulates the activity of most membrane proteins \n Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) \n Cardiolipin is normally localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane; however, when cardiolipin becomes externalized to the surface of dysregulated mitochondria, it promotes inflammasome activation and stimulates the elimination of damaged or nonfunctional mitochondria by mitophagy \n In isolated mitochondrial outer membranes, cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) increased CPT1 activity 4-fold and the Km for carnitine 6-fold.  \n Increasing levels of cardiolipin differentially influence packing of phospholipids found in the mitochondrial inner membrane. \n Here, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae subjected to conditions that affect mitochondrial metabolism as a model to determine the possible role of cardiolipin in stress adaptation.  \n This decline of respiration was attributed to a progressive diminution of the number of mitochondria in copper-treated cells, based on the demonstration of the concomitant decline of (1) cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) and cytochrome aa3 (cytochrome oxidase), two specific markers of mitochondrial inner membrane, and (2) fumarase activity, a specific marker of mitochondrial matrix space. \n Diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG) or cardiolipin, a specific component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, represents about 4% of the total lipid content. \n Experimental results confirmed that the biosynthesis of cardiolipin, from the membrane-bound radioactive phosphatidylglycerol in intact mitochondria isolated from guinea pig and rat liver, was absolutely dependent on CDP-diglycerides and required the addition of divalent cations. \n We have shown that decrease of cardiolipin in mitochondrial membrane occurs early during ischemia, and only during the irreversible phase of ischemia are phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine broken down. \n Partial purification of diphosphatidylglycerol synthetase from liver mitochondrial membranes. \n A small decrease of diphosphatidylglycerol also occurred in the hepatoma mitochondria inner membrane. \n Is diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) a phospholipid of the mitochondrial membranes?",

This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time. \n The strongest evidence was for rs1466785 in the NEIL2 (endonuclease VIII-like 2) gene (HR: 1.09, 95% CI (1.03-1.16), p = 2.7 \u00d7 10(-3)) for association with breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers, and rs2304277 in the OGG1 (8-guanine DNA glycosylase) gene, with ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR: 1.12 95%CI: 1.03-1.21, p = 4.8 \u00d7 10(-3)). \n Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility.  \n Large BRCA1 and BRCA2 genomic rearrangements in Polish high-risk breast and ovarian cancer families. \n BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two major genes associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. \n Until 2006, she supervised a diagnostic unit for BRCA gene testing at the Interdisciplinary Center for Hereditary Breast Cancer (Max Delbr\u00fcck Center, Berlin, Germany).  \n Inherited BRCA gene mutations convey a high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, but current guidelines limit BRCA mutation testing to women with early-onset cancer and relatives of mutation-positive cases.  \n Women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation face a risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer at an earlier age than women without such a mutation. \n In 2006, participants were recruited from Web sites for women with breast cancer or BRCA gene mutations.  \n About 20 % of hereditary breast cancers are caused by mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Since BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may be spread throughout the gene, genetic testing is usually performed by direct sequencing of entire coding regions. \n Suggestion of an association between BRCA2 c.7806-2A>G and risk of breast cancer in males has emerged.  \n The presence of deleterious mutations in breast cancer (BRCA)-1 or BRCA-2 gene has a decisive influence on the development of various types of neoplasms, such as breast, ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers.  \n OBJECTIVE: Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility. \n BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for 5-10% of breast and ovarian cancer cases. \n She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies. \n BACKGROUND: Women who are diagnosed with a deleterious mutation in either breast cancer (BRCA) gene have a high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers at young ages. \n We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2. \n Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. \n [Detection and occurrence of BRCA 1 gene mutation in patients with carcinoma of the breast and ovary]. \n We investigated the relationship between BRCA mutations and the distribution of familial cancers other than breast or ovary in high-risk breast cancer patients.PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO HAD AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS WERE ENROLLED: reported family history of breast or ovarian cancer; 40 years of age or younger age at diagnosis; bilateral breast cancer; or male gender \n Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are associated with increased risks for breast, ovarian, and other types of cancer.To review new evidence on the benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer in women.MEDLINE and PsycINFO between 2004 and 30 July 2013, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2004 through the second quarter of 2013, Health Technology Assessment during the fourth quarter of 2012, Scopus, and reference lists.English-language studies about accuracy of risk assessment and benefits and harms of genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions to reduce cancer incidence and mortality. \n The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of primary breast cancer (PBC) and contralateral breast cancer (CBC) in patients who had BRCA1/BRCA2-associated epithelial ovarian cancer (OC).From the database of the Rotterdam Family Cancer Clinic, patients who had BRCA-associated OC without a history of unilateral breast cancer (BC) (at risk of PBC; n = 79) or with a history of unilateral BC (at risk of CBC; n = 37) were selected \n Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families.Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations \n The USPSTF also reviewed interventions aimed at reducing the risk for BRCA-related cancer in women with potentially harmful BRCA mutations, including intensive cancer screening, medications, and risk-reducing surgery.This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who have not been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer.The USPSTF recommends that primary care providers screen women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer with 1 of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2) \n If a woman bearing a mutation develops cancer in one breast, her risk of developing cancer in the other breast depends on the particular gene that is mutated and on her age at the onset of disease.About half of all monogenically determined carcinomas of the breast and ovary are due to a mutation in one or the other of the highly penetrant BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) \n A value of RHR greater than 1 indicated elevated breast cancer risk; a value of RHR less than 1 indicated elevated ovarian cancer risk.Mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2.Breast and ovarian cancer risks.Among BRCA1 mutation carriers, 9052 women (46%) were diagnosed with breast cancer, 2317 (12%) with ovarian cancer, 1041 (5%) with breast and ovarian cancer, and 7171 (37%) without cancer \n This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.METHODS: A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries.  \n Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term. \n This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries. \n Women with a harmful mutation in the BReast CAncer (BRCA) gene are at significantly increased risk of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) during their lifetime, compared to those without. \n Genetic testing for BRCA genes, associated with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer risk, is an accepted cancer control strategy. \n Younger patients, those with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and those diagnosed more recently were more likely to be BRCA tested. \n Mutations in BRCA genes elevate risk for breast and ovarian cancer. \n Observational studies of prophylactic surgeries report reduced risks for breast and ovarian cancer in mutation carriers.No data describe the range of risk associated with BRCA mutations, genetic heterogeneity, and moderating factors; studies conducted in highly selected populations contain biases; and information on adverse effects is incomplete.A primary care approach to screening for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility has not been evaluated, and evidence is lacking to determine benefits and harms for the general population. \n We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2. For each proband, the pre-test probability of identifying a deleterious BRCA mutation was estimated using the Myriad II model. We identified 108 affected individuals who underwent large rearrangement testing (80 breast cancer, 19 ovarian cancer, nine both breast and ovarian cancer). \n Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size.RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer. One asymptomatic person--carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation--was identified in this study. She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies. \n Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Identification of BRCA mutations greatly improves the preventive strategies and management of breast cancer. \n Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families.CONCLUSIONS: Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations. \n Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size.RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer. \n However, some single risk factors without family histories (early-onset breast cancer, male breast cancer, or multiple organ cancers) may limit the utility of BRCA gene testing in the Korean population. \n BRCA Mutations Increase Fertility in Families at Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Risk. \n Because infertility is associated with breast and ovarian cancer risks, we hypothesized that the mutations in the BRCA gene may be associated with low response to fertility treatments. \n Moreover, in families of breast cancer patients without BRCA mutations, breast cancer risk depends on the patient's age at diagnosis. \n Among the 554 women who underwent genetic testing for BRCA mutation, 78 were found to have a deleterious mutation in the BRCA1 gene, and 54 had a mutation in the BRCA 2 gene. \n Frequent recurrent mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 among Hispanics, including a large rearrangement Mexican founder mutation (BRCA1 exon 9-12 deletion [ex9-12del]), suggest that an ancestry-informed BRCA-testing strategy could reduce disparities and promote cancer prevention by enabling economic screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in Mexico. \n Individuals who carry a BRCA gene mutation have increased lifetime risks of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome-related cancers. \n BRCA gene mutations have been well described to carry an increased risk of both breast and ovarian cancer. \n Ovarian cancer among 8,005 women from a breast cancer family history clinic: no increased risk of invasive ovarian cancer in families testing negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2. \n Women who were BRCA carriers, women who had a history of breast cancer, DCIS, or breast biopsy, or had a family history of ovarian cancer were more likely to have undergone surgery for cancer risk reduction. \n Genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility became a reality after two cancer predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, were identified. \n Germline mutations in BRCA genes are associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. \n We used person-years at risk to assess ovarian cancer rates in the study population, subdivided by genetic status (BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCA negative, BRCA untested) compared with the general population. \n Could BRCA gene test used for breast and ovarian cancer risk?",

One way plants achieve this is through post-translational modification of target proteins by ubiquitination and SUMOylation. \n Sumoylation is a post-translational modification essential in most eukaryotes that regulates stability, localization, activity, or interaction of a multitude of proteins. \n SUMOylation, the covalent attachment of a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins to lysines in target substrates, is an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes.  \n Post-translational modification by SUMO is a highly conserved pathway in eukaryotes that plays very important regulatory roles in many cellular processes.  \n SUMOylation is an essential post-translational modification that regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression.

We identified 70 phosphorylation and four acetylation events in proximity to SUMOylation sites, and we provide evidence for acetylation-dependent SUMOylation of endogenous histone H3.

Using high-resolution MS, we have studied global SUMOylation in human cells in a site-specific manner, identifying a total of>4,300 SUMOylation sites in>1,600 proteins. \n We quantitatively studied SUMOylation dynamics in response to SUMO protease inhibition, proteasome inhibition and heat shock. Many SUMOylated lysines have previously been reported to be ubiquitinated, acetylated or methylated, thus indicating cross-talk between SUMO and other post-translational modifications. We identified 70 phosphorylation and four acetylation events in proximity to SUMOylation sites, and we provide evidence for acetylation-dependent SUMOylation of endogenous histone H3. \n Sumoylation is a post-translational modification shown to play a role in diverse biological processes. Here, we demonstrate that sumoylation is essential for proper heterochromatin function in Drosophila through modification of SU(VAR)3-7. Indeed, SU(VAR)3-7 is sumoylated at lysine K839; this modification is required for localization of SU(VAR)3-7 at pericentric heterochromatin, chromosome 4, and telomeres. \n Sumoylation is a post-translational modification shown to play a role in diverse biological processes. Here, we demonstrate that sumoylation is essential for proper heterochromatin function in Drosophila through modification of SU(VAR)3-7. \n Our results suggest a new level of regulation of Sall activity in vivo during animal development through post-translational modification by sumoylation. \n BACKGROUND: Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier protein (SUMO) is a key regulator of nuclear functions but little is known regarding the role of the post-translational modification sumoylation outside of the nucleus, particularly in the Central Nervous System (CNS).METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report that the expression levels of SUMO-modified substrates as well as the components of the sumoylation machinery are temporally and spatially regulated in the developing rat brain. \n SUMOylation in Giardia lamblia: A Conserved Post-Translational Modification in One of the Earliest Divergent Eukaryotes. \n Identification of a novel post-translational modification in Plasmodium falciparum: protein sumoylation in different cellular compartments. \n More recently, Akt has been identified as a substrate for many different post-translational modifications, including not only phosphorylation of other residues, but also acetylation, glycosylation, oxidation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation. \n Is SUMOylation a post-translational modification in eukaryotes?",

In5 crude extract increased staining with the apoptotic marker Annexin V while no staining of healthy normal cells, i.e., na\u00efve or activated CD4 T-cells, was observed. \n At the same time, the expressions of CD105, CD31, and the apoptotic marker of Annexin V were detected through flow cytometry for analyzing the relationship between the expression of cell surface markers and biological behavior. \n However, we found decreased sperm concentration, increase of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa and increased binding of apoptotic marker annexin V.  \n hCG enhanced viability of granulosa-lutein cells through antiapoptosis but not proliferation, because the apoptotic marker of annexin V was decreased, but the proliferative markers of Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen were not increased. \n However, as the DOTAP concentration increased from 50 to 800 microM, the apoptotic marker Annexin V and ROS double positive cells increased, suggesting that high dose of DOTAP-generated ROS causes cell apoptosis.  \n Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus netilmicin, ANOVA, P<0.05). \n he apoptotic marker of annexin V was decreased \n the apoptotic marker Annexin V \n Annexin V labels apoptotic neurons following hypoxia-ischemia. \n In the present study, the apoptotic cell population was identified immunocytochemically using Annexin V, a marker of cells in an early stage of apoptosis. \n Use of annexin V antibody to identify apoptotic cells during pregnancy. \n Only few SF Treg cells were apoptotic, as indicated by limited annexin V staining of these cells. \n Eosinophils 'aged' in vitro for 48 h exhibited endonuclease DNA degradation, apoptotic morphology, increased red autofluorescence and externalisation of phosphatidylserine (PS) as assessed by binding of FITC-labelled annexin V. \n In vivo detection of apoptotic cells with fluorescently labeled annexin V is an emerging technique that we evaluated for detecting apoptotic germ cells in a mouse model of testicular torsion.Annexin V labeled with an indocyanine fluorophore (bisfunctional succinimidyl ester of cyanine 5.5) (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) was injected intravenously in mice 18 hours after the repair of unilateral 720-degree testicular torsion for 2 hours \n Here, we tested the hypothesis that enhanced endothelial apoptotic microparticles and decreased endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) levels might contribute to the pathophysiology of microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria in cardiovascular disease.Flow cytometry was used to assess endothelial cell apoptosis and circulating EPC levels by quantification of circulating CD31/annexin V apoptotic microparticles and EPC markers (defined as KDRCD133, CD34CD133, CD34KDR) in peripheral blood.In total, 125 patients with hypertension were enrolled in the study, of whom 80 patients (64%) were with normoalbuminuria (albumin excretion rate of &lt;20 microg/min, overnight urine samples), 35 patients (28%) with microalbuminuria (an albumin excretion rate of 20-200 microg/min), and 10 patients (8%) with macroalbuminuria (an albumin excretion rate >200 microg/min). \n Surfactant protein A (SP-A) binds to phosphatidylserine and competes with annexin V binding on late apoptotic cells \n Targeting of apoptotic macrophages and experimental atheroma with radiolabeled annexin V: a technique with potential for noninvasive imaging of vulnerable plaque \n Because annexin V has a high affinity for exposed phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells, radiolabeled annexin V may be used for noninvasive detection of apoptosis in atherosclerotic lesions.Atherosclerotic plaques were produced in 5 rabbits by deendothelialization of the infradiaphragmatic aorta followed by 12 weeks of cholesterol diet; 5 controls were studied without manipulation \n Apoptotic abscess imaging with 99mTc-HYNIC-rh-Annexin-V. \n Synthesis and evaluation of a 18F-labelled recombinant annexin-V derivative, for identification and quantification of apoptotic cells with PET. \n Sensitive and visible detection of apoptotic cells on Annexin-V modified substrate using aminophenylboronic acid modified gold nanoparticles (APBA-GNPs) labeling. \n Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for expression of the early apoptosis marker Annexin V and for nuclear staining by 7-aminoactinomycin (7-AAD) revealed different extents of apoptosis versus non-apoptotic cell death for the three agents. \n At immunofluorescence these cells contained lipid vesicles positive for the apoptotic cell marker Annexin V suggesting the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies derived from dead fat-laden hepatocytes. \n In this respect, we identified binding of Annexin V as an convenient marker for apoptotic cells. \n DR5 expression was elevated and associated with the apoptotic marker annexin V. Apoptosis was reduced in CD4(+) T cells when cultured with anti-DR5 antibody. \n Flow cytometric analysis using the apoptotic marker, Annexin V, shows that this endogenous re-expression is sufficient to drive the SCLC cells to apoptosis. \n Apoptotic cell death was evaluated by staining nuclei with propidium iodide and phosphatidylserine (a marker of early apoptotic events) with Annexin V as well as by DNA fragmentation assay. \n Decreased cell growth was not caused by cell death as BEL exposure did not alter nuclear morphology or increase annexin V (apoptotic cell marker) or propidium iodide (necrotic cell marker) staining after 48 h. \n Four populations of cells can be identified: region R1: vital cells (annexin V negative/PI negative), region R2: apoptotic cells (annexin V positive/PI negative), region R3: dead cells (annexin V positive/ PI positive); and region R4: damaged cells (annexin V negative/PI positive). \n Furthermore, uptake of (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V by tumors correlated with apoptotic index (r = 0.87, P = 0.02). \n Annexin V(+)/PI(-) cells were characterized as early apoptotic, Annexin V(+)/PI(+) as late apoptotic and Annexin V(-)/PI(+) as dead. \n Targeting ability of Annexin V for apoptotic macrophages was kept and enhanced. \n [18F]annexin V accumulated in the infarct area of the left ventricle, where apoptotic cells were observed. \n The viability of SiHa cells was evaluated using the MTT assay, apoptosis by acridine orange/ethidium bromide, propidium iodide, TUNEL assay, and Annexin V-Cy3, cell cycle distribution and mitochondrial transmembrane potential using flow cytometry, and apoptotic marker genes using quantitative real-time PCR.  \n Furthermore, hesperetin-induced apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL and Annexin V-Cy3. \n The procedure delivers two sperm fractions: annexin V-negative (nonapoptotic) and annexin V-positive (apoptotic). \n The percentage of cells stained with annexin V, an early apoptotic marker, increased dramatically after cytoskeletal disruption with cytochalasin D compared with non-cytochalasin-D-treated controls (P<0.05).  \n Apoptotic marker Annexin V analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of NB4 cells was increased after treatment with quercetin. \n The cytomorphology of NB4 cells was assessed by Wright-stain, apoptosis rate by apoptotic marker Annexin V, and VEGF secretion level by ELISA. \n  We have coupled annexin V with the bifunctional hydrazinonicotinamide reagent (HYNIC) to prepare technetium-99m HYNIC-annexin V and demonstrated localization of radioactivity in tissues undergoing apoptosis in vivo. \n In conlusion, these studies confirm the value of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-annexin V uptake as a marker for the detection and quantification of apoptotic cells in vivo. \n The application of Annexin V labeling at electron microscopy will allow a more refined description of the morphological events occurring during apoptosis. \n Apoptotic cells were identified by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining.  \n Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?",

We report a case of thalamic glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation, which was detected in both the primary tumor diagnosed as diffuse astrocytoma obtained during the first surgery and also in the tumor diagnosed as anaplastic astrocytoma obtained at the second surgery. \n CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates minute neuroradiological and pathological features of malignant transformation from thalamic low grade glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation. \n Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78\u00a0% of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36\u00a0% of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations. \n The pathological diagnosis was anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and we identified a mutation in histone H3.3 in the tumor specimen. \n CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric brainstem oligodendroglial tumors can include histone H3.3-mutated tumors and have a tendency to disseminate throughout the neuroaxis at the time of relapse. \n We highlight the genetic aberrations recently discovered in isocitrate dehydrogenase, alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked, death-domain-associated protein, histone H3.3, and telomerase reverse transcriptase and discuss how these mutations lead to unexpected changes in the epigenetic landscape in gliomas. \n Particularly striking is the discovery of frequent histone H3.3 mutations in pediatric glioma, a particularly aggressive neoplasm that has long remained poorly understood \n Exon sequencing has identified a mutation in K27M of the histone H3.3 gene (H3F3A K27M and G34R/V) in about 20% of pediatric glioblastomas, but it remains to be seen whether these mutations can be considered specific for pediatric diffuse high-grade astrocytomas or also occur in other pediatric brain tumors \n The histone H3.3K27M mutation in pediatric glioma reprograms H3K27 methylation and gene expression \n A lesson learned from the H3.3K27M mutation found in pediatric glioma: a new approach to the study of the function of histone modifications in vivo \n Pediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is rare, and there is a single study, a seminal discovery showing association of histone H3.3 and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1 mutation with a DNA methylation signature. \n Over 70% of diffuse intrinsic pediatric gliomas, an aggressive brainstem tumor, harbor heterozygous mutations that create a K27M amino acid substitution (methionine replaces lysine 27) in the tail of histone H3.3. \n Mutations in H3F3A, which encodes histone H3.3, commonly occur in pediatric glioblastoma. \n Somatic mutations of the H3F3A and HIST1H3B genes encoding the histone H3 variants, H3.3 and H3.1, were recently identified in high-grade gliomas arising in the thalamus, pons and spinal cord of children and young adults. \n K27M mutation in histone H3.3 defines clinically and biologically distinct subgroups of pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. \n Recurrent mutations affecting the histone H3.3 residues Lys27 or indirectly Lys36 are frequent drivers of pediatric high-grade gliomas (over 30% of HGGs). \n Use of human embryonic stem cells to model pediatric gliomas with H3.3K27M histone mutation. \n Recent studies on high-grade pediatric GBM have identified two recurrent mutations (K27M and G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3 (H3F3A for H3.3 and HIST1H3B for H3.1). \n Driver mutations in histone H3.3 and chromatin remodelling genes in paediatric glioblastoma. \n Is there an association between Histone H3.3 mutations and glioma?",

of LDL-C accumulating in the blood. \n The major goal of this study is to identify peptide/s from the catalytic domain of hPCSK9 that can block the binding of hPCSK9 and LDL-R and therefore can reduce LDL-R degradation leading to the clearance of LDL-C from the plasma. \n In vitro administration of SRT3025 to cultured AML12 hepatocytes attenuated Pcsk9 secretion and its binding to Ldlr, thereby

        "question": "TBR1 regulates autism risk genes in the developing neocortex \n Exome sequencing studies have identified multiple genes harboring de novo loss-of-function (LoF) variants in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including TBR1, a master regulator of cortical development. We performed ChIP-seq for TBR1 during mouse cortical neurogenesis and show that TBR1-bound regions are enriched adjacent to ASD genes. ASD genes were also enriched among genes that are differentially expressed in Tbr1 knockouts, which together with the ChIP-seq data, suggests direct transcriptional regulation. Of the nine ASD genes examined, seven were misexpressed in the cortices of Tbr1 knockout mice, including six with increased expression in the deep cortical layers. ASD genes with adjacent cortical TBR1 ChIP-seq peaks also showed unusually low levels of LoF mutations in a reference human population and among Icelanders. We then leveraged TBR1 binding to identify an appealing subset of candidate ASD genes. Our findings highlight a TBR1-regulated network of ASD genes in the developing neocortex that are relatively intolerant to LoF mutations, indicating that these genes may play critical roles in normal cortical development. \n T-Brain-1--A Potential Master Regulator in Autism Spectrum Disorders. \n T-Brain-1 (TBR1), a causative gene in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), encodes a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. It is therefore possible that TBR1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors. The downstream genes of TBR1 have been identified using microarray and promoter analyses. In this study, we annotated individual genes downstream of TBR1 and investigated any associations with ASDs through extensive literature searches. Of 124 TBR1 target genes, 23 were reported to be associated with ASDs. \n Among these 24 genes, four transcription factors Auts2, Nfia, Nr4a2, and Sox5 were found, suggesting that TBR1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis. A further five of the 24 genes (Cd44, Cdh8, Cntn6, Gpc6, and Ntng1) encode membrane proteins that regulate cell adhesion and axonal outgrowth. These genes likely contribute to the role of TBR1 in regulation of neuronal migration and axonal extension. Besides, decreases in Grin2b expression and increases in Gad1 expression imply that neuronal activity may be aberrant in Tbr1 deficient mice. These analyses provide direction for future experiments to reveal the pathogenic mechanism of autism. \n The activity-regulated gene expression of transcription factors is required for neural plasticity and function in response to neuronal stimulation. T-brain-1 (TBR1), a critical neuron-specific transcription factor for forebrain development, has been recognized as a high-confidence risk gene for autism spectrum disorders.  \n Disruptive mutations in the TBR1 gene have been repeatedly identified in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).  \n Next-generation sequencing recently revealed that recurrent disruptive mutations in a few genes may account for 1% of sporadic autism cases. Coupling these novel genetic data to empirical assays of protein function can illuminate crucial molecular networks. Here we demonstrate the power of the approach, performing the first functional analyses of TBR1 variants identified in sporadic autism. \n T-brain-1 (TBR1) is a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. In 1995, Tbr1 was first identified from a subtractive hybridization that compared mouse embryonic and adult telencephalons. Previous studies of Tbr1 (-\u2215-) mice have indicated critical roles for TBR1 in the development of the cerebral cortex, amygdala, and olfactory bulb. Neuronal migration and axonal projection are two important developmental features controlled by TBR1. Recently, recurrent de novo disruptive mutations in the TBR1 gene have been found in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Human genetic studies have identified TBR1 as a high-confidence risk factor for ASDs. \n TBR1 regulates autism risk genes in the developing neocortex. \n De novo TBR1 mutations in sporadic autism disrupt protein functions. \n In humans, PAX6, EOMES, and TBR1 have been linked to intellectual disability and autism. \n It is therefore possible that TBR1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors. \n Neuronal excitation upregulates Tbr1, a high-confidence risk gene of autism, mediating Grin2b expression in the adult brain. \n T-Brain-1 (TBR1), a causative gene in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), encodes a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. \n Recently, recurrent de novo disruptive mutations in the TBR1 gene have been found in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). \n Here we demonstrate the power of the approach, performing the first functional analyses of TBR1 variants identified in sporadic autism. \n Among these 24 genes, four transcription factors Auts2, Nfia, Nr4a2, and Sox5 were found, suggesting that TBR1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis. \n Disruptive mutations in the TBR1 gene have been repeatedly identified in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). \n T-Brain-1 (TBR1), a causative gene in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), encodes a brain-specific T-box transcription factor \n Among these 24 genes, four transcription factors Auts2, Nfia, Nr4a2, and Sox5 were found, suggesting that TBR1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis \n Disruptive mutations in the TBR1 gene have been repeatedly identified in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) \n Among these 24 genes, four transcription factors Auts2, Nfia, Nr4a2, and Sox5 were found, suggesting that TBR1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis. \n It is therefore possible that TBR1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors. \n TBR1 regulates autism risk genes in the developing neocortex. \n De novo TBR1 mutations in sporadic autism disrupt protein functions. \n Our findings highlight a TBR1-regulated network of ASD genes in the developing neocortex that are relatively intolerant to LoF mutations, indicating that these genes may play critical roles in normal cortical development. \n Is there any role of TBR1 in autism?",

        "question": "Telomere length is regulated around an equilibrium set point. Telomeres shorten during replication and are lengthened by telomerase. Disruption of the length equilibrium leads to disease; thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms that regulate length at the molecular level.  \n High telomerase activity is detected in nearly all human cancers but most human cells are devoid of telomerase activity. There is well-documented evidence that reactivation of telomerase occurs during cellular transformation. In humans, tumors can rely in reactivation of telomerase or originate in a telomerase positive stem/progenitor cell, or rely in alternative lengthening of telomeres, a telomerase-independent telomere-length maintenance mechanism. \n  Together, these observations may provoke a re-evaluation of telomere and telomerase based therapies, both in telomerase inhibition for cancer therapy and telomerase activation for tissue regeneration and anti-ageing strategies. \n Telomeres progressively shorten throughout life. A hallmark of advanced malignancies is the ability for continuous cell divisions that almost universally correlates with the stabilization of telomere length by the reactivation of telomerase. \n Telomerase-mediated telomere elongation provides cell populations with the ability to proliferate indefinitely.

        "question": "mTOR regulates MAPKAPK2 translation to control the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. \n Senescent cells secrete a combination of factors collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP reinforces senescence and activates an immune surveillance response, but it can also show pro-tumorigenic properties and contribute to age-related pathologies. In a drug screen to find new SASP regulators, we uncovered the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin as a potent SASP suppressor. Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1. In turn, MAPKAPK2 phosphorylates the RNA-binding protein ZFP36L1 during senescence, inhibiting its ability to degrade the transcripts of numerous SASP components. Consequently, mTOR inhibition or constitutive activation of ZFP36L1 impairs the non-cell-autonomous effects of senescent cells in both tumour-suppressive and tumour-promoting contexts. Altogether, our results place regulation of the SASP as a key mechanism by which mTOR could influence cancer, age-related diseases and immune responses. \n Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1. \n mTOR regulates MAPKAPK2 translation to control the senescence-associated secretory phenotype \n Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1 \n Here we report a mechanism by which mTOR controls the SASP by differentially regulating the translation of the MK2 (also known as MAPKAPK2) kinase through 4EBP1. \n Both Beclin1-PI3KIII and Beclin1-MAPKAPK2 interactions as were remarkably affected by silencing either ATM or MAPK14.ATM promoted IR-induced autophagy via the MAPK14 pathway, mTOR pathway and Beclin1/PI3KIII complexes. \n mTOR regulates MAPKAPK2 translation to control the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. \n Does mTOR regulate the translation of MAPKAPK2?",

        "question": "It seems likely that continued study of the methylation of H4K20 will yield extremely valuable insights concerning the regulation of histone modifications before and during cell division and the impact of these modifications on subsequent gene expression. \n Aberrant rereplication correlates with decreased levels of H4K20me1 and increased levels of H4K20 trimethylation (H4K20me3). \n Consistent with this, H4K20 methylation status plays a direct role in recruiting ORC through the binding properties of ORC1 and ORCA/LRWD1. Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in higher eukaryotes. \n H4K20 methylation regulates quiescence and chromatin compaction. \n Mass spectrometry analysis of histone modifications reveals that H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 increase in quiescence and other histone modifications are present at similar levels in proliferating and quiescent cells. \n Analysis of cells in S, G2/M, and G1 phases shows that H4K20me1 increases after S phase and is converted to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 in quiescence.  \n Overexpression of Suv4-20h1, the enzyme that creates H4K20me2 from H4K20me1, results in G2 arrest, consistent with a role for H4K20me1 in mitosis. The results suggest that the same lysine on H4K20 may, in its different methylation states, facilitate mitotic functions in M phase and promote chromatin compaction and cell cycle exit in quiescent cells. \n Histone H4 lysine 20 methylation: key player in epigenetic regulation of genomic integrity. \n  Intense research during the past few years has revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as critically important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. \n Disruption of these H4K20-specific histone methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, demonstrating the important functions of H4K20 methylation in genome maintenance.  \n Both H4K20 mono-methylation and H3K56 acetylation mark transcription-dependent histone turnover in fission yeast. \n Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me). \n These results together indicate that H4K20me1 as well as H3K56Ac are bona fide marks for transcription-dependent histone turnover in fission yeast. \n Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20 by PR-Set7 ensures the integrity of late replicating sequence domains in Drosophila. \n However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication program on a genomic scale. \n The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase PR-Set7 \n  We find that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1 results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest. \n We review the signaling pathways and functions associated with a single residue, H4K20, as a model chromatin and clinically important mark that regulates biological processes ranging from the DNA damage response and DNA replication to gene expression and silencing. \n Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in higher eukaryotes. \n We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. \n The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. \n However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication program on a genomic scale. \n Methylation of histone H4 lysine-20 has been implicated in DNA repair, transcriptional silencing, genomic stability and regulation of replication. \n Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in higher eukaryotes \n Methylation of histone H3 on lysine 79 associates with a group of replication origins and helps limit DNA replication once per cell cycle \n We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. \n We review the signaling pathways and functions associated with a single residue, H4K20, as a model chromatin and clinically important mark that regulates biological processes ranging from the DNA damage response and DNA replication to gene expression and silencing. <CopyrightInformation>\u00a9 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</C \n Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in higher eukaryotes.. \n Intense research during the past few years has revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as critically important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. \n Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?",

Conversely, strong chromatin marking is related to transcriptional and post-transcriptional stability, an association that we also observe in mammals. Our results support a model in which chromatin marking is associated with the stable production of RNA, whereas unmarked chromatin would permit rapid gene activation and deactivation during development. In the latter case, regulation by transcription factors would have a comparatively more important regulatory role than chromatin marks. \n Absence of canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes \n Absence of canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes. \n In contrast to this generally accepted view, we show that the transcription of genes temporally regulated during fly and worm development occurs in the absence of canonically active histone modifications. \n Are there canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes?",

The clinical features of this disease arise as a result of complement-mediated hemolysis in unprotected red cells, leukocytes, and platelets as well as the release of free hemoglobin. Patients may present with a variety of clinical manifestations, such as anemia, thrombosis, kidney disease, smooth muscle dystonias, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and extreme fatigue. \n The lack of one of the GPI-AP complement regulatory proteins (CD55, CD59) leads to hemolysis. The disease is diagnosed with hemolytic anemia, marrow failure and thrombosis. \n Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare bone marrow failure disorder that manifests with hemolytic anemia, thrombosis, and peripheral blood cytopenias. The absence of two glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, CD55 and CD59, leads to uncontrolled complement activation that accounts for hemolysis and other PNH manifestations. \n RESULTS: CD55 and/or CD59 deficiencies were found in 1.6% (2/127) of patients with primary BCS, 1.0% (1/100) of non-malignant and non-cirrhotic patients with PVT, and 4.7% (4/85) of cirrhotic patients with PVT. \n Data of this study indicate that the PNH defect as detected with CD55, CD59, and CD16 is not an important cause of intra-abdominal thrombosis in northwestern India. \n PNH testing of red blood cells revealed a CD55 and CD59 deficiency consistent with PNH in both cases. The systemic complications typically associated with thrombosis were not observed for the following several months with early conservative treatments including eculizumab. \n Deficiency of the GPI-anchored complement inhibitors CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes leads to intravascular hemolysis upon complement activation. Apart from hemolysis, another prominent feature is a highly increased risk of thrombosis. \n Genetic reconstitution of CD55 or treatment with a complement-inhibitory therapeutic antibody reversed abnormal complement activation.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55. \n Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal disorder characterized by a decrease or absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecules such as CD55 and CD59 from the surface of affected cells, resulting in intravascular hemolysis, cytopenia, and venous thrombosis. \n CONCLUSIONS CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55. \n CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55. \n CD55 Deficiency, Early-Onset Protein-Losing Enteropathy, and Thrombosis. \n Can CD55 deficiency cause thrombosis?",

        "question": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest arrhythmia in clinical practice and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common breathing disorder, is an independent risk factor for AF. \n There is a growing consensus in the scientific community that suggests a strong association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and cardiovascular (CVD) conditions and events, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death.  \n part from well-established risk factors that increase the odds for the development of AF, e.g. age or arterial hypertension, recent analyses indicate that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may independently, negatively modify the arrhythmia occur-rence profile.  \n Evidence supports a causal association of sleep apnea with the incidence and morbidity of hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, and stroke. \n Severe snoring may be associated with pulmonary and systemic hypertension, secondary polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias.<br> \n Severe snoring may be associated with pulmonary and systemic hypertension, secondary polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. \n BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), reportedly as a consequence of the autonomic effects of recurrent apnea with subsequent oxygen desaturation. \n Obstructive apnea is associated with myocardial ischemia (silent or symptomatic), acute coronary events, stroke and transient ischemic attacks, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. \n Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, affecting 5-15% of the population. It is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep that disrupts normal ventilation and sleep architecture, and is typically associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and witnessed apneas. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea present risk to the general public safety by causing 8-fold increase in vehicle accidents, and they may themselves also suffer from the physiologic consequences of OSA; these include hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias \n Obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration                     are associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia.  \n Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects approximately 4% of middle-aged men and 2% of middle-aged women. Cardiac arrhythmias are common problems in patients with OSA, even though the true prevalence and clinical relevance of cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined.  \n Cardiac arrhythmias during wakefulness and sleep in 15 patients with sleep-induced obstructive apnea, and the effect of atropine and tracheostomy on these arrhythmias were studied by continuous overnight Holter electrocardiographic, respiratory and electroencephalographic recordings. \n obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as its most extreme variant, is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway, leading to cessation of breathing while asleep. Cardiac arrhythmias are common problems in OSA patients, although the true prevalence and clinical relevance of cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined \n The mechanisms associated with the cardiovascular consequences of obstructive sleep apnea include abrupt changes in autonomic tone, which can trigger cardiac arrhythmias.  \n  Recent studies have shown that cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disorders are common in patients with SA. Sleep apnea \n Severity of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias correlates with intensity of sleep apnea in men \n Patients affected with OSA are frequently hypertensive and can have dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. \n Patients with stable cardiac failure who snore may present sleep hypopnea and cardiac arrhythmias.  \n  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cardiac arrhythmias are common in patients with OSA.  \n Nocturnal hypoxia has been associated with serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias as well as life-threatening bradyarrhythmias. Obesity and snoring, both of which increase with age, have been identified as risk factors for sleep-related breathing disorders, as have hypertension and heart disease. \n Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with excess daytime sleepiness, depression, and an increased incidence of ischemic cardiopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, systemic hypertension and brain infarction. \n We found 58 percent prevalence of arrhythmias in patients with sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index = AHI>10), vs 42 percent in nonapneic controls (chi 2 = 16.7, p<0.0001) \n Are sleep apnea and snoring associated with cardiac arrhythmias?",

This study reports the design principle, synthesis, and proof-of-concept application of organic semiconducting nanoparticles (OSNs) with ultralong phosphorescence for in vivo afterglow imaging.  \n This study not only introduces the first category of water-soluble ultralong phosphorescence organic nanoparticles but also reveals a universal design principle to prolong the lifetime of phosphorescent molecules to the level that can be effective for molecular imaging. \n Can nanoparticles be used for afterglow imaging?",

        "question": "IL11 is a crucial determinant of cardiovascular fibrosis. \n Using integrated imaging-genomics analyses of primary human fibroblasts, we found that Interleukin 11 (IL11) upregulation is the dominant transcriptional response to TGFB1 exposure and required for its profibrotic effect. IL11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically in fibroblasts where they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine signalling that is required for fibrogenic protein synthesis. In mice, fibroblast-specific Il11 transgene expression or Il11 injection causes heart and kidney fibrosis and organ failure whereas genetic deletion of Il11ra1 is protective against disease. Thus, inhibition of IL11 prevents fibroblast activation across organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli. These data reveal a central role of IL11 in fibrosis and we propose inhibition of IL11 as a new therapeutic strategy to treat fibrotic diseases. \n IL11 is a crucial determinant of cardiovascular fibrosis. \n Is there any role of interleukin-11 in cardiovascular fibrosis?",

Thus, our results suggest that there is a close association between hypermethylated CpG islands and the presence of nucleosomes, such that each of these epigenetic mechanisms can determine the recruitment of the other. \n Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression. \n Our results indicate that only a minority of demethylated promoters are associated with nucleosome remodeling, and these could potentially be the epigenetic drivers causing the loss of tumorigenicity. \n with repressed genes often being associated with local DNA hypermethylation and gain of nucleosomes at their promoters. \n Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this \"ground state\" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy.  \n In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps (methylomes) of multiple cellular origins. \n The mostly unmethylated CpG islands have reduced nucleosome occupancy and are enriched in cell type-independent binding sites for CTCF. \n In contrast, outside of CpG islands most CpGs are methylated, and the average methylation density oscillates so that it is highest in the linker region between nucleosomes. \n Aberrant acquisition of nucleosomes at enhancer-associated NDRs is associated with hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing marks, and conversely, loss of nucleosomes with demethylation and epigenetic activation. \n Prominent exceptions to the correlations between methylated CpG density and nucleosome occupancy include CpG islands marked by H3K27me3 and CpG-poor heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3, and these modifications, along with DNA methylation, distinguish the major silencing mechanisms of the human epigenome. \n Throughout the genome, nucleosome occupancy was correlated with certain histone methylation or acetylation modifications. \n We further show that the extent of nucleosome depletion at promoters is directly correlated to expression level and can accommodate multiple nucleosomes and provide genome-wide evidence that expressed non-CpG island promoters are nucleosome-depleted. \n Is DNA methylation correlated with nucleosome occupancy?",

Here, we systematically identified RNA-binding proteins differentially interacting with polyadenylated transcripts upon exposure of human breast carcinoma cells to ionizing radiation (IR). Interestingly, more than 260 proteins, including many nucleolar proteins, showed increased binding to poly(A)+RNA in IR-exposed cells. The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs. Upon IR exposure, DDX54 acts by increased interaction with a well-defined class of pre-mRNAs that harbor introns with weak acceptor splice sites, as well as by protein-protein contacts within components of U2 snRNP and spliceosomal B complex, resulting in lower intron retention and higher processing rates of its target transcripts.

        "question": "Co-regulation of paralog genes in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. \n Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear. In eukaryotes, genes are regulated in part by distal enhancer elements through looping interactions with gene promoters. These looping interactions can be measured by genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments, which revealed self-interacting regions called topologically associating domains (TADs). We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. To test this hypothesis, we integrated paralogy annotations with human gene expression data in diverse tissues, genome-wide enhancer-promoter associations and Hi-C experiments in human, mouse and dog genomes. We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances. Combined, our results indicate that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms and cluster not only in the linear genome but also in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. This enables concerted expression of paralogs over diverse cell-types and indicate evolutionary constraints in functional genome organization. \n Paralog genes arise from gene duplication events during evolution, which often lead to similar proteins that cooperate in common pathways and in protein complexes.

Tens to hundreds of protein-coding genes of unrelated function are arrayed in long clusters on the same DNA strand. Polycistrons are cotranscriptionally processed by trans-splicing at the 5' end and polyadenylation at the 3' end, generating monocistronic units ready for degradation or translation \n We have devised a simple chromatographic procedure which isolates five polyadenylation factors that are required for polyadenylation of eukaryotic mRNA.  \n During mammalian oocyte maturation, protein synthesis is mainly controlled through cytoplasmic polyadenylation of stored maternal mRNAs. \n Identification and characterization of a polyadenylated small RNA (s-poly A+ RNA) in dinoflagellates. \n Thus, polyadenylation seems to be a major component of the RNA editing machinery that affects overlapping genes in animal mitochondria. \n Pre-mRNA 3'-end processing, the process through which almost all eukaryotic mRNAs acquire a poly(A) tail is generally inhibited during the cellular DNA damage \n Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs possess 3' ends with a polyadenylate (poly(A)) tail. \n We previously demonstrated, by limited mutagenesis, that conserved sequence elements within the 5' end of influenza virus virion RNA (vRNA) are required for the polyadenylation of mRNA in vitro. \n Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors by poly(A) polymerase depends on two specificity factors and their recognition sequences \n The majority of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs are processed by 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation \n Formation of mRNA 3' termini involves cleavage of an mRNA precursor and polyadenylation of the newly formed end.  \n The polyadenylation of RNA is a near-universal feature of RNA metabolism in eukaryotes. \n The mechanism of RNA degradation in Escherichia coli involves endonucleolytic cleavage, polyadenylation of the cleavage product by poly(A) polymerase, and exonucleolytic degradation by the exoribonucleases,  \n The addition of poly(A)-tails to RNA is a process common to almost all organisms.  \n The addition of poly(A) tails to RNA is a phenomenon common to all organisms examined so far.  \n The addition of poly(A)-tails to RNA is a phenomenon common to almost all organisms.  \n Polyadenylation contributes to the destabilization of bacterial mRNA. \n Is polyadenylation a process that stabilizes a protein by adding a string of Adenosine residues to the end of the molecule?",

In a recent work (Tsochatzidou et al., Nucleic Acids Res 45:5818-5828, 2017), we proposed the existence of a functional compartmentalization of the yeast genome according to which, genes occupying the chromosomal regions at the nuclear periphery have distinct structural, functional and evolutionary characteristics compared to their centromeric-proximal counterparts. Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing. \n Form and function of topologically associating genomic domains in budding yeast. \n Although similar structures appear to be conserved in fission yeast, computational modeling and analysis of high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data have been used to argue that the small, highly constrained budding yeast chromosomes could not have these structures. In contrast, herein we analyze Hi-C data for budding yeast and identify 200-kb scale TADs, whose boundaries are enriched for transcriptional activity. Furthermore, these boundaries separate regions of similarly timed replication origins connecting the long-known effect of genomic context on replication timing to genome architecture. To investigate the molecular basis of TAD formation, we performed Hi-C experiments on cells depleted for the Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, previously associated with replication timing. Forkhead factors do not regulate TAD formation, but do promote longer-range genomic interactions and control interactions between origins near the centromere. Thus, our work defines spatial organization within the budding yeast nucleus, demonstrates the conserved role of genome architecture in regulating DNA replication, and identifies a molecular mechanism specifically regulating interactions between pericentric origins. \n Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing. \n Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing.  \n In contrast, herein we analyze Hi-C data for budding yeast and identify 200-kb scale TADs, whose boundaries are enriched for transcriptional activity. \n Is the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genome organized into topologically associated domains (TADs)?",

        "question": "12 years on - Is the NLM medical text indexer still useful and relevant? \n Facing a growing workload and dwindling resources, the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) created the Indexing Initiative project in 1996. This cross-library team's mission is to explore indexing methodologies for ensuring quality and currency of NLM document collections. The NLM Medical Text Indexer (MTI) is the main product of this project and has been providing automated indexing recommendations since 2002. After all of this time, the questions arise whether MTI is still useful and relevant.METHODS: To answer the question about MTI usefulness, we track a wide variety of statistics related to how frequently MEDLINE indexers refer to MTI recommendations, how well MTI performs against human indexing, and how often MTI is used. To answer the question of MTI relevancy compared to other available tools, we have participated in the 2013 and 2014 BioASQ Challenges. The BioASQ Challenges have provided us with an unbiased comparison between the MTI system and other systems performing the same task.RESULTS: Indexers have continually increased their use of MTI recommendations over the years from 15.75% of the articles they index in 2002 to 62.44% in 2014 showing that the indexers find MTI to be increasingly useful. The MTI performance statistics show significant improvement in Precision (+0.2992) and F1 (+0.1997) with modest gains in Recall (+0.0454) over the years. MTI consistency is comparable to the available indexer consistency studies. MTI performed well in both of the BioASQ Challenges ranking within the top tier teams.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded.

        "question": "Predicting Functions of Disordered Proteins with MoRFpred. \n Intrinsically disordered proteins and regions are involved in a wide range of cellular functions, and they often facilitate protein-protein interactions. Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are segments of intrinsically disordered regions that bind to partner proteins, where binding is concomitant with a transition to a structured conformation. MoRFs facilitate translation, transport, signaling, and regulatory processes and are found across all domains of life. A popular computational tool, MoRFpred, accurately predicts MoRFs in protein sequences. MoRFpred is implemented as a user-friendly web server that is freely available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/MoRFpred/ . We describe this predictor, explain how to run the web server, and show how to interpret the results it generates. We also demonstrate the utility of this web server based on two case studies, focusing on the relevance of evolutionary conservation of MoRF regions. \n MoRFPred-plus: Computational Identification of MoRFs in Protein Sequences using Physicochemical Properties and HMM profiles. \n Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) lack stable tertiary structure and they actively participate in performing various biological functions. These IDPs expose short binding regions called Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) that permit interaction with structured protein regions. Upon interaction they undergo a disorder-to-order transition as a result of which their functionality arises. Predicting these MoRFs in disordered protein sequences is a challenging task.METHOD: In this study, we present MoRFpred-plus, an improved predictor over our previous proposed predictor to identify MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. Two separate independent propensity scores are computed via incorporating physicochemical properties and HMM profiles, these scores are combined to predict final MoRF propensity score for a given residue. The first score reflects the characteristics of a query residue to be part of MoRF region based on the composition and similarity of assumed MoRF and flank regions. The second score reflects the characteristics of a query residue to be part of MoRF region based on the properties of flanks associated around the given residue in the query protein sequence. The propensity scores are processed and common averaging is applied to generate the final prediction score of MoRFpred-plus.RESULTS: Performance of the proposed predictor is compared with available MoRF predictors, MoRFchibi, MoRFpred, and ANCHOR. Using previously collected training and test sets used to evaluate the mentioned predictors, the proposed predictor outperforms these predictors and generates lower false positive rate. In addition, MoRFpred-plus is a downloadable predictor, which makes it useful as it can be used as input to other computational tools. \n OPAL: prediction of MoRF regions in intrinsically disordered protein sequences. \n Intrinsically disordered proteins lack stable 3-dimensional structure and play a crucial role in performing various biological functions. Key to their biological function are the molecular recognition features (MoRFs) located within long disordered regions. Computationally identifying these MoRFs from disordered protein sequences is a challenging task. In this study, we present a new MoRF predictor, OPAL, to identify MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. OPAL utilizes two independent sources of information computed using different component predictors. The scores are processed and combined using common averaging method. The first score is computed using a component MoRF predictor which utilizes composition and sequence similarity of MoRF and non-MoRF regions to detect MoRFs. The second score is calculated using half-sphere exposure (HSE), solvent accessible surface area (ASA) and backbone angle information of the disordered protein sequence, using information from the amino acid properties of flanks surrounding the MoRFs to distinguish MoRF and non-MoRF residues.Results: OPAL is evaluated using test sets that were previously used to evaluate MoRF predictors, MoRFpred, MoRFchibi and MoRFchibi-web. The results demonstrate that OPAL outperforms all the available MoRF predictors and is the most accurate predictor available for MoRF prediction. It is available at http://www.alok-ai-lab.com/tools/opal/. \n OPAL+: Length-Specific MoRF Prediction in Intrinsically Disordered Protein Sequences. \n Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) contain long unstructured regions, which play an important role in their function. These intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) participate in binding events through regions called molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Computational prediction of MoRFs helps identify the potentially functional regions in IDRs. In this study, OPAL+, a novel MoRF predictor, is presented. OPAL+ uses separate models to predict MoRFs of varying lengths along with incorporating the hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles and physicochemical properties of MoRFs and their flanking regions. Together, these features help OPAL+ achieve a marginal performance improvement of 0.4-0.7% over its predecessor for diverse MoRF test sets. This performance improvement comes at the expense of increased run time as a result of the requirement of HMM profiles.

Development of computational tools for the identification of candidate MoRF locations in amino acid sequences is an important task and an area of growing interest. Given the relative sparseness of MoRFs in protein sequences, the accuracy of the available MoRF predictors is often inadequate for practical usage, which leaves a significant need and room for improvement. In this work, we introduce MoRFCHiBi_Web, which predicts MoRF locations in protein sequences with higher accuracy compared to current MoRF predictors.METHODS: Three distinct and largely independent property scores are computed with component predictors and then combined to generate the final MoRF propensity scores. The first score reflects the likelihood of sequence windows to harbour MoRFs and is based on amino acid composition and sequence similarity information. It is generated by MoRFCHiBi using small windows of up to 40 residues in size. The second score identifies long stretches of protein disorder and is generated by ESpritz with the DisProt option. Lastly, the third score reflects residue conservation and is assembled from PSSM files generated by PSI-BLAST. These propensity scores are processed and then hierarchically combined using Bayes rule to generate the final MoRFCHiBi_Web predictions.RESULTS: MoRFCHiBi_Web was tested on three datasets. Results show that MoRFCHiBi_Web outperforms previously developed predictors by generating less than half the false positive rate for the same true positive rate at practical threshold values. \n Computational identification of MoRFs in protein sequences. \n In this study, we introduce MoRFCHiBi, a new computational approach for fast and accurate prediction of MoRFs in protein sequences. MoRFCHiBi combines the outcomes of two support vector machine (SVM) models that take advantage of two different kernels with high noise tolerance. The first, SVMS, is designed to extract maximal information from the general contrast in amino acid compositions between MoRFs, their surrounding regions (Flanks), and the remainders of the sequences. The second, SVMT, is used to identify similarities between regions in a query sequence and MoRFs of the training set.RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of our predictor by comparing its results with those of two currently available MoRF predictors, MoRFpred and ANCHOR. Using three test sets that have previously been collected and used to evaluate MoRFpred and ANCHOR, we demonstrate that MoRFCHiBi outperforms the other predictors with respect to different evaluation metrics. In addition, MoRFCHiBi is downloadable and fast, which makes it useful as a component in other computational prediction tools.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/morf/. \n OPAL: prediction of MoRF regions in intrinsically disordered protein sequences.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \n Computational prediction of MoRFs helps identify the potentially functional regions in IDRs. \n Can you computationally predict Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) regions in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs)?",

antipsychotic medication. \n RATIONALE: Pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 2A receptor inverse agonist, is a promising candidate for treating Parkinson's disease psychosis. \n OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to describe the efficacy and tolerability of pimavanserin, a highly selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist/antagonist indicated for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP), using the metrics of number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH). \n Pimavanserin: novel pharmacotherapy for Parkinson's disease psychosis. \n INTRODUCTION: Pimavanserin is the first FDA-approved atypical antipsychotic drug indicated for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) \n A pivotal phase III clinical trial demonstrated significant improvement in PDP symptoms in patients receiving pimavanserin compared to placebo-treated patients.  \n Pimavanserin's mechanism of action might contribute to its unique psychopharmacological properties in the improved treatment of PDP, and perhaps psychosis in other diseases including schizophrenia and dementia-related psychosis. \n Pimavanserin (Nuplazid\u2122) for the treatment of Parkinson disease psychosis: A review of the literature.Options for the treatment of Parkinson disease psychosis are limited.  \n Pimavanserin for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis.Pimavanserin is an antipsychotic with a unique mechanism of action (5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist) and no measurable dopaminergic activity; it has been demonstrated to be efficacious, well tolerated and safe for the treatment of PDP.  \n A Retrospective Study of Pimavanserin Use in a Movement Disorders Clinic.Pimavanserin, a 5-HT2A inverse agonist, was commercially released in the United States in April 2016 for the treatment of Parkinson disease psychosis.  \n receptor inverse agonist pimavanserin was recently approved by the US FDA for the treatment of PDP and may prove to be a more targeted therapy without the downsides of atypical antipsychotics. \n Evidence-Based Review of Pharmacotherapy Used for Parkinson's Disease Psychosis.Despite lack of rigor in study designs, published data to date suggest that clozapine and pimavanserin should be considered drugs of choice to treat PD psychosis. \n Pimavanserin: A novel therapeutic option for Parkinson disease psychosis.While pimavanserin appears to be a safe, effective, and well-tolerated therapeutic option for PDP, additional clinical trials and open-label extension studies are needed to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of this promising therapy.  \n Objective: Pimavanserin is the first United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment for Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP). \n Pimavanserin: A Novel Drug Approved to Treat Parkinson's Disease Psychosis. \n CONCLUSIONS\nPimavanserin is the only FDA-approved

Notably, all of them are affected by global developmental delay with speech impairment and intellectual disability; however, none displayed overt clinical signs of immune deficiency. Six frameshift mutations, two nonsense mutations, one missense mutation, and two chromosomal rearrangements resulting in diminished BCL11B expression, arose de novo. A further frameshift mutation was transmitted from a similarly affected mother. Interestingly, the most severely affected patient harbours a missense mutation within a zinc-finger domain of BCL11B, probably affecting the DNA-binding structural interface, similar to the recently published patient. Furthermore, the most C-terminally located premature termination codon mutation fails to rescue the progenitor cell proliferation defect in hippocampal slice cultures from Bcl11b-deficient mice. Concerning the role of BCL11B in the immune system, extensive immune phenotyping of our patients revealed alterations in the T cell compartment and lack of peripheral type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), consistent with the findings described in Bcl11b-deficient mice. Unsupervised analysis of 102 T lymphocyte subpopulations showed that the patients clearly cluster apart from healthy children, further supporting the common aetiology of the disorder. Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay.

        "question": "However, clinical trials of nonselective kinase inhibitors with c-Met activity (tivantinib, cabozantinib, foretinib, and golvatinib) in patients with HCC have failed so far to demonstrate significant efficacy.  \n More recently, promising outcomes have also been reported with new agents, such as nivolumab and cabozantinib.  \n Positive results in recent phase III clinical trials have confirmed the high value of anti-angiogenic therapies for HCC in both first (sorafenib and lenvatinib) and second line (regorafenib and cabozantinib) treatment modalities.  \n Expert opinion: Based on favorable phase III clinical trial data, sorafenib and lenvatinib are considered promising agents for HCC as first-line systemic chemotherapy. Moreover, regorafenib and cabozantinib are useful second-line therapies after the failure of sorafenib. \n Cabozantinib in Patients with Advanced and Progressing Hepatocellular Carcinoma. \n BACKGROUND: Cabozantinib inhibits tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, MET, and AXL, which are implicated in the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma and the development of resistance to sorafenib, the standard initial treatment for advanced disease.  \n Median overall survival was 10.2 months with cabozantinib and 8.0 months with placebo (hazard ratio for death, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.92; P=0.005). Median progression-free survival was 5.2 months with cabozantinib and 1.9 months with placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.52; P<0.001), and the objective response rates were 4% and less than 1%, respectively (P=0.009). \n CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo.  \n Positive phase III-study data have been published for lenvatinib as first-line and cabozantinib as second-line therapy.  \n More recently, regorafenib and nivolumab have received approval in the second-line setting after sorafenib, with further positive phase 3 studies emerging in the first line (lenvatinib non-inferior to sorafenib) and second line versus placebo (cabozantinib and ramucirumab).  \n The rapidly changing treatment landscape due to the emergence of new treatment options (sorafenib and lenvatinib equally effective in first line; regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab showing OS benefit in second line with nivolumab approved by the FDA based on response rate) underscores the importance of re-assessing the role of the first approved systemic agent in HCC, sorafenib. \n Rationale for use, clinical trial data, and current recommendations for cabozantinib in renal cell cancer, thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular cancer, and lung cancer are detailed in this article. \n CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo. \n The most common high-grade events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (17% with cabozantinib vs. 0% with placebo), hypertension (16% vs. 2%), increased aspartate aminotransferase level (12% vs. 7%), fatigue (10% vs. 4%), and diarrhea (10% vs. 2%).<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: Among patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo. \n Cabozantinib in Patients with Advanced and Progressing Hepatocellular Carcinoma.Among patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo.  \n CONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo. \n CONCLUSIONS Among patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo. \n CONCLUSIONS The tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib (first line) and regorafenib (second line) have been approved for hepatocellular carcinoma, and the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab obtained conditional approval for sorafenib-experienced patients in the United States. \n The principal advancements in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are the use of new systemic treatments such as lenvatinib in first-line treatment and regorafenib, cabozantinib and ramucirumab in second-line treatment due to their benefits in terms of overall survival. \n Recently, a few systemic chemotherapies proved to be effective for advanced stage HCC in phase III studies: lenvatinib as the first line of therapy, and regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab as second-line therapy. \n <b>BACKGROUND</b>: The approval of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib in 2007 marked a milestone in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, as sorafenib was the first systemic therapy to show a survival benefit in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. \n We also elaborate the unmet need of biomarkers to guide treatment decisions and discuss the emerging field of immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: The tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib (first line) and regorafenib (second line) have been approved for hepatocellular carcinoma, and the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab obtained conditional approval for sorafenib-experienced patients in the United States. \n Cabozantinib in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. \n The approval of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib in 2007 marked a milestone in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, as sorafenib was the first systemic therapy to show a survival benefit in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. \n Among patients with previously treated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, treatment with cabozantinib resulted in longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo. \n More recently, promising outcomes have also been reported with new agents, such as nivolumab and cabozantinib. \n  Positive phase III-study data have been published for lenvatinib as first-line and cabozantinib as second-line therapy.  \n Is cabozantinib effective for hepatocellular carcinoma?",

        "question": "Promoter shape varies across populations and affects promoter evolution and expression noise. \n Animal promoters initiate transcription either at precise positions (narrow promoters) or dispersed regions (broad promoters), a distinction referred to as promoter shape. Although highly conserved, the functional properties of promoters with different shapes and the genetic basis of their evolution remain unclear. Here we used natural genetic variation across a panel of 81 Drosophila lines to measure changes in transcriptional start site (TSS) usage, identifying thousands of genetic variants affecting transcript levels (strength) or the distribution of TSSs within a promoter (shape). Our results identify promoter shape as a molecular trait that can evolve independently of promoter strength. Broad promoters typically harbor shape-associated variants, with signatures of adaptive selection. Single-cell measurements demonstrate that variants modulating promoter shape often increase expression noise, whereas heteroallelic interactions with other promoter variants alleviate these effects. These results uncover new functional properties of natural promoters and suggest the minimization of expression noise as an important factor in promoter evolution. \n Promoter shape varies across populations and affects promoter evolution and expression noise \n Does promoter shape vary across populations?",

Using an inducible degron system in avian cells, we find that AND-1 depletion is incompatible with proliferation, owing to cells accumulating in G2 with activated DNA damage checkpoint. Replication without AND-1 causes fork speed slow-down and accumulation of long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps at the replication fork junction, with these regions being converted to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in G2. Strikingly, resected forks and DNA damage accumulation in G2, but not fork slow-down, are reverted by treatment with mirin, an MRE11 nuclease inhibitor.

Cell proliferation was tested by [H3] DNA incorporation assay. Cell apoptosis was tested by caspase-3/-9 activity assay, Histone DNA ELISA assay, Annexin V FACS assay and TUNEL staining assay. Cell cycle progression was tested by propidium iodide (PI) FACS assay. Signaling was tested by Western blotting assay. The nude mice PC-3 xenograft model was applied to test AZD5153's activity in vivo.RESULTS: AZD5153 inhibited proliferation and survival of established and primary prostate cancer cells.

Here, we show that the Mcm2-Ctf4-Pol\u03b1 axis facilitates the transfer of parental (H3-H4)2 tetramers to lagging-strand DNA at replication forks. Mutating the conserved histone-binding domain of the Mcm2 subunit of the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) DNA helicase, which translocates along the leading-strand template, results in a marked enrichment of parental (H3-H4)2 on leading strand, due to the impairment of the transfer of parental (H3-H4)2 to lagging strands. Similar effects are observed in Ctf4 and Pol\u03b1 primase mutants that disrupt the connection of the CMG helicase to Pol\u03b1 that resides on lagging-strand template.

They included calcium channel antagonists, NMDA receptor antagonists, lubeluzole, CDP-choline, the free radical scavenger tirilazad and ebselen, enlimomab, GABA agonist clomethiazole, the sodium channel antagonist fosphenytoin, magnesium, glycine site antagonist GV150526 and piracetam.  \n CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to show an efficacy of lubeluzole in the treatment of acute stroke.  \n Overall, of all treated patients, 401 (22.5%) died: 203 (22.5%) in the lubeluzole group and 198 (22.4%) with placebo. Of all subjects treated, 853 (95%) on lubeluzole and 826 (93%) on placebo reported an adverse event during their treatment period or within the next 2 days after discontinuation of treatment. \n CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with lubeluzole within 6 hours of the onset of ischemic stroke had a nonsignificant effect on mortality and resulted in improved clinical outcome compared with placebo, with no safety concerns. \n RESULTS: The overall mortality rate at 12 weeks for lubeluzole-treated patients was 20.7% compared to 25.2% for placebo-treated patients (NS). Controlling for relevant covariates, the degree of neurological recovery (NIHSS) at week 12 significantly favored lubeluzole over placebo (P = .033). Lubeluzole treatment similarly resulted in significantly greater improvements in functional status (Barthel Index) (P = .038) and overall disability (Rankin Scale) (P = .034) after 12 weeks. A global test statistic confirmed that lubeluzole-treated patients had a more favorable clinical outcome at 12 weeks (P = .041). \n CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute ischemic stroke, the dosage regimen of 7.5 mg over 1 hour followed by 10 mg/d of intravenous lubeluzole is safe and statistically significantly reduced mortality.  \n CONCLUSIONS\n\nTreatment with lubeluzole within 6 hours of the onset of ischemic stroke had a nonsignificant effect on mortality and resulted in improved clinical outcome compared with placebo, with no safety concerns. \n CONCLUSIONS: Lubeluzole, given in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke, is not associated with a significant reduction of death or dependency at the end of scheduled follow-up period but seems to be associated with a significant increase of heart-conduction disorders (Q-T prolonged >450 msec). \n Treatment with lubeluzole within 6 hours of the onset of ischemic stroke had a nonsignificant effect on mortality and resulted in improved clinical outcome compared with placebo, with no safety concerns. \n In the overall study population, treatment with intravenous lubeluzole within 6 h of the onset of ischaemic stroke did not affect mortality or clinical outcome. \n Should Lubeluzole be used for treatment of ischemic stroke?",

        "question": "External Beam Radiotherapy Increases the Risk of Bladder Cancer When Compared with Radical Prostatectomy in Patients Affected by Prostate Cancer: A Population-based Analysis. \n On multivariable competing risk regression analyses, treatment with EBRT was independently associated with the risk of developing a second primary BCa (hazard ratio: 1.35, CI: 1.18-1.55; p<0.001), but not RCa (p=0.4).  \n CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with EBRT are at increased risk of developing a second primary BCa compared with those treated with RP. However, no differences were found considering RCa incidence in patients treated with RP or EBRT within the first 5 yr after primary therapy.  \n We found that those treated with external beam radiotherapy are at an increased risk of developing a second primary bladder cancer tumor. \n All radiation modalities were found to have an increased RR of developing BlCa after 10\u00a0years, with brachytherapy having a significantly higher RR than external beam radiation (EBRT) or combined EBRT and brachytherapy in Caucasian men and a significantly higher RR than EBRT in men of other/unknown ethnicity.  \n CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of BlCa after prostate radiation occurs predominantly after 10\u00a0years, regardless of ethnicity. The RR of developing BlCa after 10\u00a0years is significantly higher following brachytherapy than after EBRT or EBRT and brachytherapy.  \n Based on the data in the literature, there is a\u00a0consistently increased risk of bladder cancer (HR: 1.67, 95% CI 1.55-1.80), rectal cancer (HR: 1.79, 95% CI 1.34-2.38), and colorectal cancer (HR: 1.79, 95% CI 1.34-23.8) following percutaneous radiation therapy. Following brachytherapy only an increased for the development of bladder cancer (HR: 2.14, 95% CI 1.03-3.94) has been observed. \n When comparing with a matched general French population, the standard incidence ratio (SIR) for bladder cancer was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.46-1.93). \n LDR resulted in lower bladder cancer risks than HDR, and lower or similar risks of rectal cancer. \n Compared to external beam techniques, second rectal and bladder cancer risks were lowest for brachytherapy. \n OBJECTIVE: Although it is well known that radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer, the effect of aging and smoking with radiotherapy on incidence rate of secondary bladder cancer remains unknown.  \n RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 4.3 and 3.1 years, secondary bladder cancer occurred in 11 (3.4%) and 5 (1.1%) of patients with prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy, respectively.  \n CONCLUSIONS\n\nMen who receive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer have an increased risk of bladder cancer compared to patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and compared to the general population. \n Radiation therapy for prostate cancer increases subsequent risk of bladder and rectal cancer: a population based cohort study. \n RESULTS\n\nThe relative risk of bladder cancer developing after external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy compared to radical prostatectomy was 1.88, 1.52 and 1.85, respectively. \n Compared to the general United States population the standardized incidence ratio for bladder cancer developing after radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy was 0.99, 1.42, 1.10 and 1.39, respectively. \n OBJECTIVE\n\nAlthough it is well known that radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer, the effect of aging and smoking with radiotherapy on incidence rate of secondary bladder cancer remains unknown. \n OBJECTIVE\nAlthough it is well known that radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer, the effect of aging and smoking with radiotherapy on incidence rate of secondary bladder cancer remains unknown. \n CONCLUSIONS\nMen who receive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer have an increased risk of bladder cancer compared to patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and compared to the general population. \n PURPOSE\nPre-prostate specific antigen era series demonstrated an increased risk of bladder cancer and rectal cancer in men who received radiotherapy for prostate cancer. \n RESULTS\nThe relative risk of bladder cancer developing after external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy compared to radical prostatectomy was 1.88, 1.52 and 1.85, respectively. \n CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings suggest that smoking history might be one of criteria to choose radical prostatectomy than external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer, and that age would not be a criterion for therapeutic selection in terms of secondary bladder cancer. \n PURPOSE: Pre-prostate specific antigen era series demonstrated an increased risk of bladder cancer and rectal cancer in men who received radiotherapy for prostate cancer. \n RESULTS: The relative risk of bladder cancer developing after external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy compared to radical prostatectomy was 1.88, 1.52 and 1.85, respectively. \n Compared to the general United States population the standardized incidence ratio for bladder cancer developing after radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy was 0.99, 1.42, 1.10 and 1.39, respectively. \n Pre-prostate specific antigen era series demonstrated an increased risk of bladder cancer and rectal cancer in men who received radiotherapy for prostate cancer. \n Men who receive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer have an increased risk of bladder cancer compared to patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and compared to the general population. \n The relative risk of bladder cancer developing after external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy compared to radical prostatectomy was 1.88, 1.52 and 1.85, respectively. \n Radiotherapy for prostate cancer is associated with an increased incidence of secondary bladder cancer (BC). \n Radiation therapy for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. \n Radiotherapy for prostate cancer was associated with higher risks of developing second malignancies of the bladder, colon, and rectum compared with patients unexposed to radiotherapy, but the reported absolute rates were low. \n Does radiotherapy for prostate cancer increase bladder cancer risk?",

        "question": "Genes with monoallelic expression contribute disproportionately to genetic diversity in humans. \n An unexpectedly large number of human autosomal genes are subject to monoallelic expression (MAE). Our analysis of 4,227 such genes uncovers surprisingly high genetic variation across human populations. This increased diversity is unlikely to reflect relaxed purifying selection. Remarkably, MAE genes exhibit an elevated recombination rate and an increased density of hypermutable sequence contexts. However, these factors do not fully account for the increased diversity. We find that the elevated nucleotide diversity of MAE genes is also associated with greater allelic age: variants in these genes tend to be older and are enriched in polymorphisms shared by Neanderthals and chimpanzees. Both synonymous and nonsynonymous alleles of MAE genes have elevated average population frequencies. We also observed strong enrichment of the MAE signature among genes reported to evolve under balancing selection. We propose that an important biological function of widespread MAE might be the generation of cell-to-cell heterogeneity; the increased genetic variation contributes to this heterogeneity. \n Genes with monoallelic expression contribute disproportionately to genetic diversity in humans \n Do genes with monoallelic expression contribute proportionally to genetic diversity in humans?",

        "question": "Deletion at 6q24.2-26 predicts longer survival of high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer patients. \n Standard treatments for advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs) show significant side-effects and provide only short-term survival benefits due to disease recurrence. Thus, identification of novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers is urgently needed. We have used 42 paraffin-embedded HGSOCs, to evaluate the utility of DNA copy number alterations, as potential predictors of clinical outcome. Copy number-based unsupervised clustering stratified HGSOCs into two clusters of different immunohistopathological features and survival outcome (HR = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.03-0.81; Padj = 0.03). We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). The prognostic value of this deletion was validated in two independent series, one consisting of 36 HGSOCs analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (P = 0.04) and another comprised of 411 HGSOCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA) (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.48-0.93, Padj = 0.019). In addition, we confirmed the association of low expression of the genes from the region with longer survival in 799 HGSOCs (HR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.61-0.90, log-rank P = 0.002) and 675 high-FIGO stage HGSOCs (HR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.61-0.96, log-rank P = 0.02) available from the online tool KM-plotter. Finally, by integrating copy number, RNAseq and survival data of 296 HGSOCs from TCGA we propose a few candidate genes that can potentially explain the association. Altogether our findings indicate that the 6q24.2-26 deletion is an independent marker of favorable outcome in HGSOCs with potential clinical value as it can be analyzed by FISH on tumor sections and guide the selection of patients towards more conservative therapeutic strategies in order to reduce side-effects and improve quality of life. \n We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). \n OBJECTIVE\n\nWe aimed to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of the nucleotide excision repair-related gene GTF2H5, which is localized at the 6q24.2-26 deletion previously reported by our group to predict longer survival of high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients. \n We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). \n OBJECTIVE\nWe aimed to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of the nucleotide excision repair-related gene GTF2H5, which is localized at the 6q24.2-26 deletion previously reported by our group to predict longer survival of high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients. \n OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of the nucleotide excision repair-related gene GTF2H5, which is localized at the 6q24.2-26 deletion previously reported by our group to predict longer survival of high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients. \n We aimed to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of the nucleotide excision repair-related gene GTF2H5, which is localized at the 6q24.2-26 deletion previously reported by our group to predict longer survival of high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients. \n Is deletion at 6q24.2-26 associated with shorter survival for ovarian cancer patients?",

        "question": "Neurotrophic factors are among the most promising treatments aiming at slowing or stopping and even reversing Parkinson's disease (PD). However, in most cases, they cannot readily cross the human blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Herein, we propose as a therapeutic for PD the small molecule 17-beta-spiro-[5-androsten-17,2'-oxiran]-3beta-ol (BNN-20), a synthetic analogue of DHEA, which crosses the BBB and is deprived of endocrine side-effects. Using the \"weaver\" mouse, a genetic model of PD, which exhibits progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the Substantia Nigra (SN), we have shown that long-term administration (P1-P21) of BNN-20 almost fully protected the dopaminergic neurons and their terminals, via i) a strong anti-apoptotic effect, probably mediated through the Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) neurotrophin receptor's PI3K-Akt-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, ii) by exerting an efficient antioxidant effect, iii) by inducing significant anti-inflammatory activity and iv) by restoring Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels. By intercrossing \"weaver\" with NGL mice (dual GFP/luciferase-NF-\u03ba\u0392 reporter mice, NF-\u03ba\u0392.GFP.Luc), we obtained Weaver/NGL mice that express the NF-\u03baB reporter in all somatic cells. Acute BNN-20 administration to Weaver/NGL mice induced a strong NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional response in the brain as detected by bioluminescence imaging, which was abolished by co-administration of the TrkB inhibitor ANA-12. This indicates that BNN-20 exerts its beneficial action (at least in part) through the TrkB-PI3K-Akt-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. These results could be of clinical relevance, as they suggest BNN-20 as an important neuroprotective agent acting through the TrkB neurotrophin receptor pathway, mimicking the action of the endogenous neurotrophin BDNF. Thus BNN-20 could be proposed for treatment of PD. \n Is BNN20 involved in Parkinson's disease?",

        "question": "MRPL53, a New Candidate Gene for Orofacial Clefting, Identified Using an eQTL Approach. \n A valuable approach to understand how individual and population genetic differences can predispose to disease is to assess the impact of genetic variants on cellular functions (e.g., gene expression) of cell and tissue types related to pathological states. To understand the genetic basis of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) susceptibility, a complex and highly prevalent congenital malformation, we searched for genetic variants with a regulatory role in a disease-related tissue, the lip muscle (orbicularis oris muscle [OOM]), of affected individuals. From 46 OOM samples, which are frequently discarded during routine corrective surgeries on patients with orofacial clefts, we derived mesenchymal stem cells and correlated the individual genetic variants with gene expression from these cultured cells. Through this strategy, we detected significant cis-eQTLs (i.e., DNA variants affecting gene expression) and selected a few candidates to conduct an association study in a large Brazilian cohort (624 patients and 668 controls). This resulted in the discovery of a novel susceptibility locus for NSCL/P, rs1063588, the best eQTL for the MRPL53 gene, where evidence for association was mostly driven by the Native American ancestry component of our Brazilian sample.

        "question": "Transcribed ultraconserved region Uc.63+ promotes resistance to docetaxel through regulation of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer. \n The transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of non-coding RNAs that are absolutely conserved across species and are involved in carcinogenesis including prostate cancer (PC). In this study, we investigated the transcriptional levels of 26 representative T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differentially expressed in PC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of T-UCR Uc.63+ was increased in PC tissues. MTT assay and wound healing assay revealed that Uc.63+ was involved in cell growth and cell migration. miR-130b was predicted to have binding sites within the Uc.63+ sequence. The expression of miR-130b was significantly disturbed by the overexpression or knockdown of Uc.63+. We also showed that Uc.63+ regulated the expression of MMP2 via miR-130b regulation. Furthermore, overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation. In patients treated with docetaxel, the expression of serum Uc.63+ in the docetaxel-resistant patients was higher than that in the docetaxel-sensitive patients (P = 0.011). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression of serum Uc.63+ correlated with a worse prognosis (P = 0.020). These results substantially support the important role that Uc.63+ plays in PC progression by interacting with miR-130b and indicate that Uc.63+ could potentially be a promising serum marker for deciding the best treatment for patients with CRPC. \n Transcribed ultraconserved region Uc.63+ promotes resistance to docetaxel through regulation of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer \n These results substantially support the important role that Uc.63+ plays in PC progression by interacting with miR-130b and indicate that Uc.63+ could potentially be a promising serum marker for deciding the best treatment for patients with CRPC \n Furthermore , overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation \n These results substantially support the important role that Uc.63+ plays in PC progression by interacting with miR-130b and indicate that Uc.63+ could potentially be a promising serum marker for deciding the best treatment for patients with CRPC. \n Furthermore, overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation. \n These results substantially support the important role that Uc.63+ plays in PC progression by interacting with miR-130b and indicate that Uc.63+ could potentially be a promising serum marker for deciding the best treatment for patients with CRPC. \n Does Uc.63+ promote sensitivity to treatment in prostate cancer?",

oligodendroglioma which had been followed by a course of 6\u2009weeks radiotherapy (58\u2009Gy) and 6 cycles of temozolomide.  \n Radiation-induced osteosarcoma after Gamma Knife surgery for vestibular schwannoma: a case report and literature review. \n We present a rare case of radiation-induced osteosarcoma following Gamma Knife\u00ae surgery (GKS) for a vestibular schwannoma (VS).  \n The osteosarcoma was considered to be a radiation-induced malignancy.  \n Radiation-induced osteosarcoma of the maxilla and mandible after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. \n The purpose of this study was to analyze the association of clinicopathologic characteristics with treatment outcomes and prognostic factors of patients who developed RIOSM after undergoing radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). \n Of these patients, 47 who developed RISOM and met inclusion criteria were included in this study.  \n CONCLUSIONS: RISOM after radiotherapy for NPC is aggressive and often eludes early detection and timely intervention. \n Radiation-induced osteosarcoma of the\u00a0skull base after radiation therapy in a patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a\u00a0case report and review of the\u00a0literature. \n BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced osteosarcomas are a recognized complication of radiation therapy.  \n CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a rare case of a patient with a

the\u00a0skull base after treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a very rare but very aggressive complication with a poor prognosis. \n Radiation-Associated Low-Grade Extraskeletal Osteosarcoma of the Neck Following Treatment for Thyroid Cancer. \n Low-grade extraskeletal osteosarcoma is a rare tumor that may arise de novo or following radiation therapy. \n While there is a report of a low-grade extraskeletal osteosarcoma arising following radiotherapy for a benign condition, to the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of a low-grade extraskeletal osteosarcoma occurring following radiotherapy for thyroid cancer, and the only case reported in the soft tissue of the head and neck region.  \n Here we a report a case of radiation induced osteosarcoma which developed 11\u2009years after a single fraction of 700\u2009cGy. \n Osteosarcoma following single fraction radiation prophylaxis for heterotopic ossification. \n The radiotherapy dose for this patient is lower than classically reported for radiation induced sarcomas. \n The latency period between radiotherapy and osteosarcoma onset was 1.3 years shorter inside than outside the radiation field. \n Osteosarcoma after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. \n Osteosarcoma after external beam radiation therapy for recurrent choroidal melanoma. \n Diagnostic criteria were fulfilled and the lesion was classified as a radiation induced osteosarcoma \n Although a rare complication of ionizing radiation, radiation-induced osteosarcoma is now more frequently recognized as radiation therapy has become common and cancer survival has increased \n Here we a report a case of radiation induced osteosarcoma which developed 11 years after a single fraction of 700 cGy \n Radiation-induced osteosarcoma usually occurs after a long latency period of more than 10 years after the radiotherapy \n Osteosarcoma following radiotherapy: a case report. \n Radiation-induced fibrosarcoma after radiotherapy for

0.01 % -0.03 % among all patients treated with radiotherapy \n Radiation-induced osteosarcoma is a well-known but rare complication of radiotherapy for brain neoplasms with a poor prognosis \n The prognosis of patients developing osteosarcoma after radiotherapy for prostate cancer is similar to other radiation-induced osteosarcomas occurring in the axial skeleton , with a 50 % overall mortality within the first year after diagnosis \n Radiation-induced osteosarcoma usually occurs after a long latency period of more than 10 years after the radiotherapy \n Twenty-seven years 11 months after orthovoltage radiotherapy of the right breast a 69-year-old woman developed a radiation-induced osteosarcoma of the right thoracic wall \n We report a case of radiation-induced osteosarcoma developed from skull after 7 years of craniospinal radiotherapy for pineoblastoma \n Although the concepts of direct and indirect effects of radiation are fully applicable to low-LET ( linear energy transfer ) radioresistant tumor cells/normal tissues such as osteosarcoma cells and chondrocytes , it is believed that radiation-associated damage to DNA does not play a major role in the mechanism of cell death in low-LET radiosensitive tumors/normal tissues such as malignant lymphoma cells and lymphocytes \n From these clinicopathological findings, both cases were diagnosed as radiation-induced osteosarcoma. \n Here we report two cases of radiation-induced osteosarcoma in the paranasal sinus after treatment for frontal glioma. \n As the prognosis of radiation-induced osteosarcoma is poorer than that of primary osteo-sarcoma, careful attention is required for consideration of the long-term survival of patients with glioma. \n Radiation-induced osteosarcomas appeared 16 and 12 years after radiotherapy in cases 1 and 2, respectively. \n Most radiation-induced osteosarcomas of the skull are reported to arise in the facial bone or paranasal sinus after radiotherapy for retinoblastoma and/or pituitary adenoma. \n Radiation-induced osteosarcomas after treatment for frontal gliomas: a report of two cases. \n Radiation-induced osteosarcoma of the skull mimicking cutaneous tumor after

cases of radiation-induced osteosarcomas after radiotherapy for gliomas. \n Here, we report a unique case of radiation-induced osteosarcomas arising on the skull and extending to the skin, with a short latent period. \n BACKGROUND\nThe increasing incidence of radiation-induced osteosarcoma of the maxilla and mandible (RIOSM) has become a significant problem that can limit long-term survival. \n In this case, osteosarcoma was possibly a radiation-induced osteosarcoma with a short latency period of 3 years. \n Radiation-induced osteosarcoma usually occurs after a long latency period of more than 10 years after the radiotherapy. \n A case of osteosarcoma arising in the craniofacial bone with a short latency period of 3 years after radiotherapy for maxillary squamous cell carcinoma is described. \n Osteosarcoma is one of the neoplasms that may occur following exposure to radiation. \n As the prognosis of radiation-induced osteosarcoma is poorer than that of primary osteo-sarcoma,

osteosarcoma. \n Radiation-induced osteosarcoma is one of the rare types of radiation-induced sarcomas, with the risk of radiation-induced osteosarcomas being only 0.01%-0.03% among all patients treated with radiotherapy. \n There have been only four reported cases of radiation-induced osteosarcomas after radiotherapy for gliomas. \n Although radiation-induced osteosarcoma is an uncommon but dire complication of radiotherapy, its incidence will probably increase in the future as the frequency of radiation treatment and cancer survival increase. \n We report a case of radiation-induced osteosarcoma developed from skull after 7 years of craniospinal radiotherapy for pineoblastoma. \n The prognosis of patients developing osteosarcoma after radiotherapy for prostate cancer is similar

Early phase clinical trials have established the safety profile of this agent and have shown promising efficacy in combination with low-dose dexamethasone and other anti-MM agents. The combination of selinexor and dexamethasone has demonstrated activity in \"penta-refractory\" MM, (ie, MM refractory to the 5 most active anti-MM agents currently used in treatment). \n We found that DEX in combination with selinexor, an inhibitor of exportin-1 (XPO1) activity, synergistically inhibits the mTOR pathway and subsequently promotes cell death in MM cells.  \n The current findings are consistent with the beneficial therapeutic outcome in patients with MM when treated with the combination of selinexor and DEX.  \n Selinexor plus low-dose bortezomib and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. \n Selinexor is an oral inhibitor of the nuclear export protein exportin 1 (XPO1). Preclinical studies demonstrated synergistic antimyeloma activity between selinexor and proteasome inhibitors (PI) though suppression of NF\u03baB signaling and nuclear retention of tumor suppressor proteins. \n Targeting XPO1 with selinexor (the selective inhibitor of nuclear export; SINE compound KPT-330) demonstrates broad antitumor activity also in patient cells resistant to bortezomib; hence, it is a promising target in MM patients. Hypoxia is known to mediate tumor progression and drug resistance (including bortezomib resistance) in MM cells. \n Selinexor, used as a single agent, delayed tumor initiation and tumor progression, prolonging mice survival.

We performed molecular analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 898 Greek families, using Sanger sequencing or Next Generation Sequencing for the detection of small insertion/deletion frameshift, nonsynonymous, truncating and splice-site alterations and MLPA for the detection of large genomic rearrangements. In total, a pathogenic mutation was identified in 12.9% of 898 families analyzed. Of the 116 mutations identified in total 9% were novel and 14.7% were large genomic rearrangements.

Here we explore a new hypothesis: that there is no motor, and thermal motion within the nucleus drives extrusion. \n We observed that a single condensin complex is able to extrude tens of kilobase pairs of DNA at a force-dependent speed of up to 1500 base pairs per second, using the energy of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis \n Our model explains what can be the driving force of chromatin loop extrusion and how it can be ensured that loops grow quickly and in a good direction. In addition, the supercoiling-driven loop extrusion mechanism is consistent with earlier explanations proposing why TADs flanked by convergent CTCF binding sites form more stable chromatin loops than TADs flanked by divergent CTCF binding sites. \n Oligomerization and ATP stimulate condensin-mediated DNA compaction. \n Strikingly, without ATP, we observe the emergence of hundreds of CTCF-independent loops that link regulatory DNA. \n DNA compaction by cohesin requires adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis and is force sensitive. \n The identification and quantification of further initiation steps--ATP binding and extrusion of an initial DNA loop--allowed us to deduce a complete kinetic reinitiation scheme. \n In support of this model, single-molecule imaging experiments indicate that Saccharomyces cerevisiae condensin complexes can extrude DNA loops in an ATP-hydrolysis-dependent manner in\u00a0vitro. \n These structures depend on cohesin, a ring-shaped DNA-entrapping adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) complex that has been proposed to form loops by extrusion. \n Loop formation and maintenance depend on cohesin's ATPase activity and on NIPBL-MAU2, but not on topological entrapment of DNA by cohesin. \n Is the process of DNA loop-extrusion independent of ATP?",

        "question": "Transcription Start Site Mapping Using Super-low Input Carrier-CAGE. \n SLIC-CAGE: high-resolution transcription start site mapping using nanogram-levels of total RNA. \n Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) is a methodology for genome-wide quantitative mapping of mRNA 5' ends to precisely capture transcription start sites at a single nucleotide resolution. In combination with high-throughput sequencing, CAGE has revolutionized our understanding of the rules of transcription initiation, led to discovery of new core promoter sequence features, and discovered transcription initiation at enhancers genome-wide. The biggest limitation of CAGE is that even the most recently improved version (nAnT-iCAGE) still requires large amounts of total cellular RNA (5 \u00b5g), preventing its application to scarce biological samples such as those from early embryonic development or rare cell types. Here, we present SLIC-CAGE, a Super-Low Input Carrier-CAGE approach to capture 5' ends of RNA polymerase II transcripts from as little as 5-10 ng of total RNA. This dramatic increase in sensitivity is achieved by specially designed, selectively degradable carrier RNA. We demonstrate the ability of SLIC-CAGE to generate data for genome-wide promoterome with 1000-fold less material than required by existing CAGE methods, by generating a complex, high-quality library from mouse embryonic day 11.5 primordial germ cells. \n Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) is a method used for single-nucleotide resolution detection of RNA polymerase II transcription start sites (TSSs). Accurate detection of TSSs enhances identification and discovery of core promoters. In addition, active enhancers can be detected through signatures of bidirectional transcription initiation. Described here is a protocol for performing super-low input carrier-CAGE (SLIC-CAGE). This SLIC adaptation of the CAGE protocol minimizes RNA losses by artificially increasing the RNA amount through use of an in vitro transcribed RNA carrier mix that is added to the sample of interest, thus enabling library preparation from nanogram-amounts of total RNA (i.e., thousands of cells). The carrier mimics the expected DNA library fragment length distribution, thereby eliminating biases that could be caused by the abundance of a homogenous carrier. In the last stages of the protocol, the carrier is removed through degradation with homing endonucleases and the target library is amplified. The target sample library is protected from degradation, as the homing endonuclease recognition sites are long (between 18 and 27 bp), making the probability of their existence in the eukaryotic genomes very low. The end result is a DNA library ready for next-generation sequencing. All steps in the protocol, up to sequencing, can be completed within 6 days. The carrier preparation requires a full working day; however, it can be prepared in large quantities and kept frozen at -80 \u00b0C. Once sequenced, the reads can be processed to obtain genome-wide single-nucleotide resolution TSSs. TSSs can be used for core promoter or enhancer discovery, providing insight into gene regulation. Once aggregated to promoters, the data can also be used for 5'-centric expression profiling. \n Is SLIC-CAGE used for quantification of translation?",

Laboratory studies were carried out in human mCRPC organoid cultures, prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, and mouse xenograft models. Epigenetic studies were carried out in a rapid autopsy cohort.RESULTS: Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) expression is increased in DNPC relative to prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-expressing mCRPC in the Stand Up to Cancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation discovery cohort (11.2 v 0.28 reads per kilobase per million mapped reads; q < 0.05; n = 117) and in the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center cohort (9.2 v 0.99 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads; P < .0001). DKK1 expression can be regulated by activated Wnt signaling in vitro and correlates with activating canonical Wnt signaling mutations and low PSA mRNA in mCRPC biopsies (P < .05). DKK1 hypomethylation was associated with increased DKK1 mRNA expression (Pearson r = -0.66; P < .0001) in a rapid autopsy cohort (n = 7). DKK1-high mCRPC biopsies are infiltrated with significantly higher numbers of quiescent natural killer (NK) cells (P < .005) and lower numbers of activated NK cells (P < .0005). Growth inhibition of the human PCa model PC3 by the anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibody DKN-01 depends on the presence of NK cells in a severe combined immunodeficient xenograft mouse model.CONCLUSION: These results support DKK1 as a contributor to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of DNPC.

In vivo, Bm \n Nanog is a newly identified transcriptional factor bearing a homeodomain and expressed in pluripotential cells of preimplantation and early postimplantation embryos, and embryonic stem (ES) and embryonic germ (EG) cells. \n Knockout experiments indicate that Nanog functions as a key player in maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells. \n Thus, in germ cell development, NANOG is expressed in proliferating germ cells, in which nuclear reprogramming is progressing. \n Nanog maintains pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells by inhibiting NFkappaB and cooperating with Stat3. \n We performed a genome-wide screen that combined full-length mESC transcriptome genomic mapping data with chromatin immunoprecipitation genomic location maps of the key mESC transcription factors Oct4 and Nanog. \n Nanog safeguards pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). \n Notably, the expression of Nanog, a key pluripotency regulator and repressor of extraembryonic endoderm specification in ES cells, was significantly reduced in Zic3 knockdown cells. \n Is Nanog repressed in pluripotent stem cells?",

Interestingly, the effects of overexpressed Tcf3 differ between HCT-116 and HCT-R cells \n In HCT-R cells, however, the overexpression of Tcf3 inhibits Wnt activity, and the cells are still able to proliferate due to the higher expression levels of cell cycle factors, particularly those driving the G(1) to S transition. \n TCF3 (also known as TCF7L1) is a member of the TCF/LEF transcription factor family that is central in regulating epidermal and embryonic stem cell identity. \n We found that in contrast to ES cells, where it represses Wnt-pathway target genes, TCF3 promotes the expression of a subset of Wnt-responsive genes in breast cancer cells while repressing another distinct target subset. In the normal mouse mammary gland, Tcf3 is highly expressed in terminal end buds, structures that lead duct development \n Tcf3 is essential within the neural ectoderm to maintain anterior character and that its interaction with Hesx1 ensures the repression of Wnt targets in the developing forebrain. \n We report here that a terminal component of the canonical Wnt pathway in ES cells, the transcription factor T-cell factor-3 (Tcf3), co-occupies promoters throughout the genome in association with the pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Nanog.  \n Our results suggest that the Wnt pathway, through Tcf3, brings developmental signals directly to the core regulatory circuitry of ES cells to influence the balance between pluripotency and differentiation. \n The wnt pathway regulates the steady state level of beta-catenin, a transcriptional coactivator for the Tcf3/Lef1 family of DNA binding proteins. \n Along with evidence that a significant amount of Tcf protein is nonnuclear, these findings suggest that CK1epsilon can modulate wnt signaling in vivo by regulating both the beta-catenin-Tcf3 and the GBP-dsh interfaces. \n RA increases the expression of ligands and receptors of the noncanonical Wnt pathway (Wnt 5a, 7a, Fzd2 and Fzd6), downstream signaling, and Tcf3 expression. \n The noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway, through actions of Tcf3, can antagonize the canonical pathway. \n We report here that a terminal component of the canonical Wnt pathway in ES cells, the transcription factor T-cell factor-3 (Tcf3), co-occupies promoters throughout the genome in association with the pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Nanog. \n Both Tcf3 depletion and Wnt pathway activation cause increased expression of Oct4, Nanog, and other pluripotency factors and produce ES cells that are refractory to differentiation. \n Here, we show that injection of a hesx1 morpholino into a 'sensitised' zygotic headless (tcf3) mutant background leads to severe forebrain and eye defects, suggesting an interaction between Hesx1 and the Wnt pathway during zebrafish forebrain development. \n In addition, we reveal that Tcf3 is essential within the neural ectoderm to maintain anterior character and that its interaction with Hesx1 ensures the repression of Wnt targets in the developing forebrain. \n TCF3, a novel positive regulator of osteogenesis, plays a crucial role in miR-17 modulating the diverse effect of canonical Wnt signaling in different microenvironments. \n Our studies located the position of Wnts, downstream LEF1 and TCF3 and stem cell marker proteins, which provide new information in understanding the role of the Wnt singaling pathway in whisker follicles' growth. \n The transcription factor T-cell factor 3 (TCF3), one component of the Wnt pathway, is known as a cell-intrinsic inhibitor of many pluripotency genes in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that influences the balance between pluripotency and differentiation. \n Overexpression of TCF3 attenuated the effect of miR-17 on modulating canonical Wnt signaling. \n We also find that TCF3 phosphorylation is triggered by canonical Wnt ligands, LRP6, and dominant negative mutants for Axin and GSK3, indicating that this process shares the same upstream regulators with \u03b2-catenin stabilization. \n Wnt pathway stimulation also triggers \u03b2-catenin association at regulatory elements with classic Lef/Tcf motifs associated with differentiation programs. \n We show that menin physically interacts with proteins involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, including beta-catenin, TCF3 (TCFL1), and weakly with TCF4 (TCFL2). \n T-cell factor 3 (Tcf3) is a component of the Wnt signaling and a dominant downstream effector in ESCs. \n  factor 3 (Tcf3) is a component of the Wnt signaling and a dominant downstream effector in ESCs.

The frequency of CT examination showed strong correlation with the subsequent overall risk of malignancy and benign brain tumour.CONCLUSIONS: We found that paediatric head CT examination was associated with an increased incidence of benign brain tumour. \n CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that CT-related radiation exposure increases brain tumor risk.  \n Compared with the general population, incidence of brain tumors was higher in the cohort of children with CT scans, requiring cautious interpretation of the findings. \n BACKGROUND: Recent studies linking radiation exposure from pediatric computed tomography (CT) to increased risks of leukemia and brain tumors lacked data to control for cancer susceptibility syndromes (CSS).  \n IMPACT: Future studies should identify TSC patients in order to avoid overestimation of brain tumor risks due to radiation exposure from CT scans. \n The radiation-induced occurrence of meningiomas and other brain tumours most probably contributes to the continuously increasing incidence of these diseases which is observed in several industrial nations, as well as the exposure of the bone marrow by CT to the increase of childhood leukaemia. \n 1,000 annual paediatric CT investigations of the skull will lead to about 3 excess neoplasms in the head region, i.e., the probability of an induced late effect must be suspected in the range of some thousandths.  \n Does head ct increase brain tumor risk?",

Functional tests were performed to study their pathogenicity and understand the disease mechanism.RESULTS: The consistent clinical features of the affected individuals, from seven unrelated families, included choanal atresia, athelia or hypoplastic nipples, branchial sinus abnormalities, neck pits, lacrimal duct anomalies, hearing loss, external ear malformations, and thyroid abnormalities. None of the individuals had intellectual disability.

R \n lectronic databases and registries were searched for recommendations on MTX use in RA, duplicates were eliminated, and the most updated version adopted when there were several versions on the same recommendation.  \n MTX must at the present time be used only in severe RA, refractory to more than one classical slow acting drug. \n MTX is as effective in treating RA as the other second line drugs and always more rapidly effective, perhaps because of anti-inflammatory properties. \n For the low doses used in RA (less than 15 mg/week), MTX is completely and rapidly absorbed with an active process membrane transport. \n Methotrexate, which is used for RA treatment, causes thrombocytopenia. \n Methorexate therapy in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis complicated by idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. \n This case shows that methotrexate may be used in patients diagnosed with RA that is associated with ITP under strict monitoring. \n Here, we report an RA case that also had ITP, which did not decrease in platelet count after methotrexate therapy. \n We started methotrexate therapy 10 mg per week for treatment of RA, and hydroxychloroquine therapy was stopped due to nonresponse. \n Methotrexate (MTX) is the anchor treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has been very thoroughly studied in many different patient populations, as monotherapy and in combination with various other disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic agents, as they became available. \n Although rheumatologists have been using methotrexate in the treatment of RA for some time, controlled studies have been needed to establish the safety and efficacy of this agent. \n Methotrexate is generally the first-line drug for the treatment of RA, psoriatic arthritis and other forms of inflammatory arthritis, and it enhances the effect of most biologic agents in RA. \n Despite the introduction of numerous biologic agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of inflammatory arthritis, low-dose methotrexate therapy remains the gold standard in RA therapy. \n A number of studies show the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in general. \n Methotrexate (MTX) is currently the most frequently used drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). \n Methotrexate (MTX) has been the anchor treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over the last 15 years, and is used in combination with biologic agents to enhance efficacy over the last decade or so. \n Is methotrexate used for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)?",

        "question": "Adenosine Signaling Is Prognostic for Cancer Outcome and Has Predictive Utility for Immunotherapeutic Response. \n There are several agents in early clinical trials targeting components of the adenosine pathway including A2AR and CD73. The identification of cancers with a significant adenosine drive is critical to understand the potential for these molecules. However, it is challenging to measure tumor adenosine levels at scale, thus novel, clinically tractable biomarkers are needed.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated a gene expression signature for the adenosine signaling using regulatory networks derived from the literature and validated this in patients. We applied the signature to large cohorts of disease from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cohorts of immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated patients.RESULTS: The signature captures baseline adenosine levels in vivo (r 2 = 0.92, P = 0.018), is reduced after small-molecule inhibition of A2AR in mice (r 2 = -0.62, P = 0.001) and humans (reduction in 5 of 7 patients, 70%), and is abrogated after A2AR knockout. Analysis of TCGA confirms a negative association between adenosine and overall survival (OS, HR = 0.6, P < 2.2e-16) as well as progression-free survival (PFS, HR = 0.77, P = 0.0000006). Further, adenosine signaling is associated with reduced OS (HR = 0.47, P < 2.2e-16) and PFS (HR = 0.65, P = 0.0000002) in CD8+ T-cell-infiltrated tumors. Mutation of TGF\u03b2 superfamily members is associated with enhanced adenosine signaling and worse OS (HR = 0.43, P < 2.2e-16). Finally, adenosine signaling is associated with reduced efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in published cohorts (HR = 0.29, P = 0.00012).CONCLUSIONS: These data support the adenosine pathway as a mediator of a successful antitumor immune response, demonstrate the prognostic potential of the signature for immunotherapy, and inform patient selection strategies for adenosine pathway modulators currently in development. \n Is adenosine signaling prognostic for cancer outcome?",

D. mela \n This Zelda-mediated chromatin accessibility facilitates transcription-factor recruitment and early gene expression. \n While analyzing chromatin immunoprecipitation data sets from 21 sequence-specific transcription factors active in the Drosophila embryo, we found that binding of all factors exhibits a dose-dependent relationship with \"TAGteam\" sequence motifs bound by the zinc finger protein Vielfaltig, also known as Zelda, a recently discovered activator of the zygotic genome. \n These different timing classes each associate with binding sites for two transcription factors, GAGA-factor and Zelda, previously implicated in controlling chromatin accessibility at ZGA. \n Together this reveals a distinct requirement for a chromatin remodeller in promoting the activity of the pioneer factor OCT4 and regulating the pluripotency network. \n Chromatin accessibility at OCT4-bound sites requires the chromatin remodeller BRG1, which is recruited to these sites by OCT4 to support additional transcription factor binding and expression of the pluripotency-associated transcriptome. \n The pioneer factor OCT4 requires the chromatin remodeller BRG1 to support gene regulatory element function in mouse embryonic stem cells. \n Pioneer transcription factors recognise and bind their target sequences in inaccessible chromatin to establish new transcriptional networks throughout development and cellular reprogramming. \n During this process, pioneer factors establish an accessible chromatin state to facilitate additional transcription factor binding, yet it remains unclear how different pioneer factors achieve this. \n Here, we discover that the pluripotency-associated pioneer factor OCT4 binds chromatin to shape accessibility, transcription factor co-binding, and regulatory element function in mouse embryonic stem cells. \n Open chromatin is associated with Zelda-bound loci, as well as more generally with regions of active transcription. \n Unexpectedly, chromatin at a large subset of Zelda-bound regions remains open even in the absence of Zelda. \n During this developmental transition, the zygotic genome is largely transcriptionally quiescent and undergoes significant chromatin remodeling. \n Here we used formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements to determine the role of Zelda in regulating regions of open chromatin in the early embryo. \n Pioneer transcription factors can engage nucleosomal DNA, which leads to local chromatin remodeling and to the establishment of transcriptional competence. \n Recently, we showed that Zelda acts through specific chromatin patterns of histone modifications to mark developmental enhancers and active promoters. \n The zinc-finger TF zelda (zld) is essential for the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) in Drosophila melanogaster, where it directly binds over thousand cis-regulatory modules to regulate chromatin accessibility. \n Nonetheless, the extent to which Zelda influences chromatin accessibility across the genome is largely unknown. \n We present evidence that Zld facilitates binding of Dl to regulatory DNA, and that this is associated with increased chromatin accessibility. \n ZRF1 facilitates the remodeling of multiprotein complexes at chromatin and lies at the heart of signaling processes that occur at DNA damage sites and during transcriptional activation. \n We postulate that ZRF1 operates in conjunction with cellular remodeling machines and suggest that on-site remodeling might be a hallmark of many chromatin-associated signaling pathways. \n Reconstituted transcription reactions established that the Brahma (BRM) chromatin-remodeling complex is essential for Zeste-directed activation on nucleosomal templates. \n Is the zelda transcription factor a chromatin remodeller?",

The comet assay (as this method was subsequently named) was able to measure, for the first time, the fraction of radiobiologically hypoxic cells in mouse and human tumors. It was used to determine that the rate of rejoining of DNA breaks was relatively homogenous within an irradiated population of cells \n The comet assay is frequently used to measure DNA damage in individual cells.  \n Thus a complete repair of DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation and measurable by the Comet assay was observed, whereas the yield of somatic mutations increased in relation to the radiation dose. \n xanthi) mutagenicity assay is the ability to analyze and compare on the same plants under identical treatment conditions both the induced acute DNA damage in somatic cells as measured by the Comet assay and the yield of induced leaf somatic mutations. \n The present study reveals that gamma radiation induces single strand breaks in DNA as measured by alkaline comet assay in bivalves and comet assay serves as a sensitive and rapid method to detect genotoxicity of gamma radiation. \n The present study is aimed (a) to know the genotoxic effect of gamma radiation on aquatic fauna employing two species of selected bivalves, (b) to evaluate the possible use of 'Comet assay' for detecting genetic damage in haemocytes of bivalves as a biomarker for environmental biomonitoring and also (c) to compare the relative sensitivity of two species of bivalves viz. \n The single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay, more commonly known as the comet assay, due to the \"comet-like\" appearance of the cells, was originally developed as a technique to measure the presence of DNA single-strand breaks. \n BACKGROUND: The neutral comet assay was devised to measure double-stranded DNA breaks, but it has also been used to measure apoptosis based on its characteristic DNA fragmentation patterns. \n 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 Gy) of gamma radiation and their genotoxic effects on the haemocytes were studied using the comet assay. \n PURPOSE: The Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Comet assay, being a quick, simple, sensitive, reliable and fairly inexpensive method for measuring DNA strand breaks, has been used to assess DNA damage caused by gamma radiation in developmental stages of maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky. \n This paper attempts a correlation between the induction and repair of DNA damage measured in the comet assay and the clinical observed reaction in order to evaluate the suitability of the comet assay for prediction of radiation sensitivity. \n gle cell gel electrophoresis (e.g., Comet Assay) and immunofluoresence microscopy to detect the presence of gamma-H2AX foci, we find that Cr[VI] induces DNA double-strand breaks similar to ionizing radiation (IR).

The tumor-suppressing function of CYLD is associated with its deubiquitinating activity, which maps to the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein. In the present study we evaluated the role of intestinal epithelial CYLD in colitis-associated cancer using a conditional mouse CYLD inactivation model.METHODS: In order to evaluate the role of CYLD in intestinal epithelial carcinogenesis, mice (IEC-Cyld (\u03949) mice) that carry a mutation that eliminates the deubiquitinating domain of CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) were generated by crossing Villin-Cre transgenic mice to previously generated mice carrying a loxP-flanked Cyld exon 9 (Cyld (flx9) mice).RESULTS: We found that IEC-Cyld (\u03949) mice did not present spontaneous intestinal abnormalities up to one year of age. However, upon challenge with a combination of genotoxic (AOM) and pro-inflammatory (DSS) agents we found that the number of adenomas in the IEC-Cyld (\u03949) mice was dramatically increased compared to the control mice. Inactivation of CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells did not affect the classical nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) and c-Jun kinase (JNK) activation pathways under physiological conditions, suggesting that these pathways do not predispose CYLD-deficient intestinal epithelia to colorectal cancer development before the onset of genotoxic and/or pro-inflammatory stress.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore a critical tumor-suppressing role for functional intestinal epithelial CYLD in colitis-associated carcinogenesis.

The  \n This review focuses on three of the most common entrapment neuropathies in the upper limbs: carpal tunnel syndrome (median nerve entrapment at the wrist), cubital tunnel syndrome (ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow), and radial tunnel syndrome (posterior interosseous nerve entrapment). \n Electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing is usually an essential part of the evaluation of entrapment neuropathies, and examinations for the most common entrapment neuropathies, carpal tunnel syndrome and ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, constitute a significant part of the daily work in EDX laboratories. \n This study reviews the existing, more or less, detailed EDX criteria or practice parameters that are suggested by consensus groups in peer-reviewed journals for the most common entrapment neuropathies: carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, common peroneal (fibular) neuropathy at the fibular head, and tibial neuropathy at the tarsal tunnel. \n This report demonstrates that the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test and nerve conduction studies can identify entrapment of the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve concomitant with carpal tunnel syndrome. \n Entrapment neuropathy of the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve concomitant with carpal tunnel syndrome: a case report. \n A case of the entrapment neuropathy of the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve, concomitant with carpal tunnel syndrome is presented. \n The entrapment syndromes discussed are suprascapular nerve entrapment, carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, meralgia paraesthetica, thoracic outlet syndrome and anterior interosseous nerve syndrome. \n Carpal tunnel syndrome is a neuropathy resulting from compression of the median nerve as it passes through a narrow tunnel in the wrist on its way to the hand. \n More typically, carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common peripheral entrapment neuropathy encountered in industry. \n Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most frequently encountered peripheral nerve entrapment. \n Carpal tunnel syndrome, an entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve, is rarely seen in childhood. \n Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common type of peripheral nerve entrapment and is a significant cause of morbidity. \n Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a nerve entrapment disorder, involving the median nerve when it passes the carpal tunnel at the wrist. \n The carpal tunnel syndrome is the most frequent entrapment syndrome of peripheral nerves. \n BACKGROUND: Compression of the median nerve at the wrist, or carpal tunnel syndrome, is the most commonly recognized nerve entrapme \n Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common of the median nerve entrapments. \n BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is by far the most common entrapment neuropathy ( \n Introduction: Carpal tunnel syndrome, entrapment of median nerve at the wrist, is one of the most commonly encountered peripheral neuropathies in the up \n Carpal tunnel syndrome, a median nerve entrapment neuropathy, is characterized by sensorimotor deficits. \n Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common form of peripheral nerve entrapment, which is observed due to compression of the median nerve at the level of the carpal tunnel in the wrist. \n [Carpal tunnel syndrome and other nerve entrapment syndromes]. \n Is carpal tunnel syndrome a type of nerve entrapment?",

        "question": "Rare variants in PPARG with decreased activity in adipocyte differentiation are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. \n By sequencing PPARG in 19,752 T2D cases and controls drawn from multiple studies and ethnic groups, we identified 49 previously unidentified, nonsynonymous PPARG variants (MAF < 0.5%). Considered in aggregate (with or without computational prediction of functional consequence), these rare variants showed no association with T2D (OR = 1.35; P = 0.17). The function of the 49 variants was experimentally tested in a novel high-throughput human adipocyte differentiation assay, and nine were found to have reduced activity in the assay. Carrying any of these nine LOF variants was associated with a substantial increase in risk of T2D (OR = 7.22; P = 0.005).

        "question": "PDXK mutations cause polyneuropathy responsive to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate supplementation. \n To identify disease-causing variants in autosomal recessive axonal polyneuropathy with optic atrophy and provide targeted replacement therapy.METHODS: We performed genome-wide sequencing, homozygosity mapping, and segregation analysis for novel disease-causing gene discovery. We used circular dichroism to show secondary structure changes and isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the impact of variants on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding. Pathogenicity was further supported by enzymatic assays and mass spectroscopy on recombinant protein, patient-derived fibroblasts, plasma, and erythrocytes. Response to supplementation was measured with clinical validated rating scales, electrophysiology, and biochemical quantification.RESULTS: We identified biallelic mutations in PDXK in 5 individuals from 2 unrelated families with primary axonal polyneuropathy and optic atrophy. The natural history of this disorder suggests that untreated, affected individuals become wheelchair-bound and blind. We identified conformational rearrangement in the mutant enzyme around the ATP-binding pocket. Low PDXK ATP binding resulted in decreased erythrocyte PDXK activity and low pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) concentrations. We rescued the clinical and biochemical profile with PLP supplementation in 1 family, improvement in power, pain, and fatigue contributing to patients regaining their ability to walk independently during the first year of PLP normalization.INTERPRETATION: We show that mutations in PDXK cause autosomal recessive axonal peripheral polyneuropathy leading to disease via reduced PDXK enzymatic activity and low PLP. We show that the biochemical profile can be rescued with PLP supplementation associated with clinical improvement.

MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. \n

To date, no study has characterized the mucocutaneous features seen in hospitalized children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or the temporal association of these findings with the onset of systemic symptoms.Objective: To describe the mucocutaneous findings seen in children with MIS-C during the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in New York City in 2020.Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective case series was conducted of 35 children admitted to 2 hospitals in New York City between April 1 and July 14, 2020, who met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or epidemiologic criteria for MIS-C.Main Outcomes and Measures: Laboratory and clinical characteristics, with emphasis on mucocutaneous findings, of children who met criteria for MIS-C. \n This condition, since defined as the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), is assumed to be a delayed immune response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and there are frequently cardiac manifestations of ventricular dysfunction and/or coronary artery dilation.Methods: We surveyed the inpatient MIS-C management approaches of the members of the International Kawasaki Disease Registry across 38 institutions and 11 countries.Results: Among the respondents, 56% reported using immunomodulatory treatment for all MIS-C patients, regardless of presentation. \n DESIGN: Children ages 0-22\u00a0years with suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presenting to urgent care clinics or being hospitalized for confirmed/suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at Massachusetts General Hospital were offered enrollment in the Massachusetts General Hospital Pediatric COVID-19 Biorepository. \n We recently discovered a superantigen-like motif, similar to Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), near the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, which might explain the multisystem-inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) observed in children and cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients. \n METHODS: An extensive search strategy was conducted by combining the terms multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and coronavirus infection or using the term multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in bibliographic electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and

We investigated the long-term outcome of GKRS-treated DNTs at our institution in the context of current diagnostic and treatment options. \n Long-term seizure control was obtained after GKRS of two separate residual DNT components along the surgical margin (2005 and 2010). A 27-year-old male undergoing gross total resection of the contrast-enhancing portion of a DNT (1999) resulted in temporary control of intractable epilepsy despite AEDs; lasting clinical control of seizures was achieved in 2002 after GKRS of a small, recurrent DNT component. A 28-year-old male underwent STR of DNT (1994 and 2004) resulting in temporary control of intractable epilepsy. Lasting seizure control was gained after GKRS of a residual tumor (2005).CONCLUSION: GKRS as performed in our series was effective in terms of tumor and seizure control. \n Prospective studies are warranted to establish the role of GKRS in the treatment of DNTs. \n Two rare cases of intractable epilepsy caused by Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumours (DNET) are reported and their different management discussed.
