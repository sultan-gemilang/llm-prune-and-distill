    "Let's think step by step. No, the results of the study do not support the hypothesis that the LR and SE acuity are different in strabismus amblyopia. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Assessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. \n 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. \n Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups.

    "Let's think step by step. No, the long-term results of the transanal pull-through were not equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: The transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) is becoming the most popular procedure in the treatment of Hirschsprung disease (HD), but overstretching of the anal sphincters remains a critical issue that may impact the continence. This study examined the long-term outcome of TERPT versus conventional transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for HD. \n Records of 41 patients more than 3 years old who underwent a pull-through for HD (TERPT, n = 20; ABD, n = 21) were reviewed, and their families were thoroughly interviewed and scored via a 15-item post-pull-through long-term outcome questionnaire. Patients were operated on between the years 1995 and 2003. During this time, our group transitioned from the ABD to the TERPT technique. Total scoring ranged from 0 to 40: 0 to 10, excellent; 11 to 20 good; 21 to 30 fair; 31 to 40 poor. A 2-tailed Student t test, analysis of covariance, as well as logistic and linear regression were used to analyze the collected data with confidence interval higher than 95%. \n Overall scores were similar. However, continence score was significantly better in the ABD group, and the stool pattern score was better in the TERPT group. A significant difference in age at interview between the 2 groups was noted; we therefore reanalyzed the data controlling for age, and this showed that age did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome between groups. \n Are the long-term results of the transanal pull-through equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n1.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Anchoring vignettes are brief texts describing a hypothetical character who illustrates a certain fixed level of a trait under evaluation. This research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan. \n We investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for differences in response category cut-points for each individual. \n The prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex was no longer a significant factor.

The objective of this study was to determine whether automated, at-the-visit tailored prompts about family history risk change PCP behavior. \n Automated, tailored prompts highlighting familial risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and breast, colorectal, or ovarian cancer were implemented during 2011 to 2012. Medical records of a cohort of community-based primary care patients, aged 35 to 65 years, who previously participated in our Family Healthware study and had a moderate or strong familial risk for any of the 6 diseases were subsequently reviewed. The main outcome measures were PCP response to the prompts, adding family history risk to problem summary lists, and patient screening status for each disease. \n The 492 eligible patients had 847 visits during the study period; 152 visits had no documentation of response to a family history prompt. Of the remaining 695 visits, physician responses were reviewed family history (n = 372, 53.5%), discussed family history (n = 159, 22.9%), not addressed (n = 155, 22.3%), and reviewed family history and ordered tests/referrals (n = 5, 0.7%).

To date, there is no evidence supporting that EUS fellowships enhance residents' ultrasound (US) educational experiences. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of EUS fellowships on emergency medicine (EM) residents' US education. \n We conducted a cross-sectional study at 9 academic medical centers. A questionnaire on US education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the emergency department. The secondary outcomes were factors that would impact residents' US education. The outcomes were compared between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships. \n A total of 244 EM residents participated in this study. Thirty percent (95% confidence interval, 24%-35%) reported they had performed more than 150 scans. Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more scans than those in programs without fellowships (P = .04).

Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. \n Routine clinic protocols for follow-up--telephone call, letter, or certified letter--were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on a Pap smear or recommended examination. \n Documented adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact the patients for follow-up, adherence to follow-up recommendations, and patient characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of adherence to follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine multivariate relationships related to adherence. \n The rate of overall adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Radiotherapy reduces local recurrence rates but is also capable of short- and long-term toxicity. It may also render treatment of local recurrence more challenging if it develops despite previous radiotherapy. \n This study examined the impact of radiotherapy for the primary rectal cancer on outcomes after pelvic exenteration for local recurrence. \n We conducted a retrospective review of exenteration databases. \n The study took place at a quaternary referral center that specializes in pelvic exenteration. \n Patients referred for pelvic exenteration from October 1994 to November 2012 were reviewed. Patients who did and did not receive radiotherapy as part of their primary rectal cancer treatment were compared. \n The main outcomes of interest were resection margins, overall survival, disease-free survival, and surgical morbidities. \n There were 108 patients, of which 87 were eligible for analysis. Patients who received radiotherapy for their primary rectal cancer (n = 41) required more radical exenterations (68% vs 44%; p = 0.020), had lower rates of clear resection margins (63% vs 87%; p = 0.010), had increased rates of surgical complications per patient (p = 0.014), and had a lower disease-free survival (p = 0.022).

    "Let's think step by step. Eye-tracking abnormality is not a consequence of motion perception deficit. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Studies have shown that schizophrenia patients have motion perception deficit, which was thought to cause eye-tracking abnormality in schizophrenia. However, eye movement closely interacts with motion perception. The known eye-tracking difficulties in schizophrenia patients may interact with their motion perception. \n Two speed discrimination experiments were conducted in a within-subject design. In experiment 1, the stimulus duration was 150 msec to minimize the chance of eye-tracking occurrence. In experiment 2, the duration was increased to 300 msec, increasing the possibility of eye movement intrusion. Regular eye-tracking performance was evaluated in a third experiment. \n At 150 msec, speed discrimination thresholds did not differ between schizophrenia patients (n = 38) and control subjects (n = 33). At 300 msec, patients had significantly higher thresholds than control subjects (p = .03). Furthermore, frequencies of eye tracking during the 300 msec stimulus were significantly correlated with speed discrimination in control subjects (p = .01) but not in patients, suggesting that eye-tracking initiation may benefit control subjects but not patients. The frequency of eye tracking during speed discrimination was not significantly related to regular eye-tracking performance. \n Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n1.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: For women, the correlation between circulating androgens and sexual desire is inconclusive. Substitution with androgens at physiological levels improves sexual function in women who experience decreased sexual desire and androgen deficiency from surgical menopause, pituitary disease, and age-related decline in androgen production in the ovaries. Measuring bioactive testosterone is difficult and new methods have been proposed, including measuring the primary androgen metabolite androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G).AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate a possible correlation between serum levels of androgens and sexual desire in women and whether the level of ADT-G is better correlated than the level of circulating androgens with sexual desire. \n This was a cross-sectional study including 560 healthy women aged 19-65 years divided into three age groups. Correlations were considered to be statistically significant at P<0.05. \n Sexual desire was determined as the total score of the sexual desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index. Total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and ADT-G were analyzed using mass spectrometry. \n Sexual desire correlated overall with FT and androstenedione in the total cohort of women. In a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years with no use of systemic hormonal contraception, sexual desire correlated with TT, FT, androstenedione, and DHEAS.

We investigated the association between IBR, complications and adjuvant chemotherapy delivery. \n Retrospective analysis of patients in an academic breast service, who underwent mastectomy, with or without reconstruction, and received adjuvant chemotherapy. \n Comparisons were made between 107 patients who received IBR and 113 who received mastectomy alone. Those receiving IBR were on average younger, with lower body mass index (BMI) and better prognoses. Overall complication rates were comparable (mastectomy alone: 45.1% versus IBR: 35.5%, p = 0.2). There was more return to surgery in the IBR group with 11.5% of tissue expanders requiring removal, whilst more seromas occurred in the mastectomy group.

These associations were then adjusted for confounding by a series of factors measured in childhood. \n The three disorder groups had rates of adult MD during the period 18-35 years that were significantly (p<.05) higher than that of the group with no disorder. Furthermore, those in the comorbid MD/AUD group had significantly (p<.05) higher rates of adult MD than those in the AUD-only group, and marginally (p<.10) higher rates of adult MD than those in the MD-only group. After adjustment for confounding, the difference in rates of adult MD between the MD-only group and the MD/AUD group were no longer statistically significant.

A significant reduction in the \"no-flow-time\", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme\u00ae (LMAS) in the manikin. \n An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated. \n A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space).

In adolescent boys type I prepuce was observed in 1 boy only, 1.6%, whereas type V was observed in 82.3%. Furthermore, it was observed that at the time of examination for the study 106 boys who had undergone forced dilation at an earlier age had balano-prepucial adhesions again, which demonstrates that prepuce adheres again to glans penis in many boys after a forced dilation is performed. Only 11 boys were considered in need for circumcision, three of them for prepucial orifice stenosis, which prevented normal micturition, causing a prepucial sac, one case due to a constrictive ring below the prepucial edge that would have prevented ulterior retractability, two cases with repetitive balanopostitis, and five cases secondary to xerosol balanitis, accounting for 2.7% of all examined boys. \n Should circumcision be performed in childhood?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThere are no advantages to circumcision.\nThe disadvantages are:\n(a) pain\n(b) scar\n(c) possible infection\n(d) possible bleeding\n(e) possible hemorrhage\n(f) possible adhesions\n(g) possible balanoposthitis\n(h) possible infection\n(i) possible balanitis xerotica obliterans\n(j) possible skin tags\n(",

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Reconstructing the natural joint line in knee revision surgery improves clinical and functional outcome but may be challenging when both cartilage and bone were removed during previous operations. Assessing joint lines (JLs) by means of bony landmarks is inadvisable because of large variations in human anatomy. Because of the inherent symmetry of the human body, we hypothesised that JLs may be directly assessed by measuring the distances from the bony landmarks to the JL of the contralateral knee by means of radiographic images. \n Using scaled weight-bearing radiographs in anteroposterior view of both knees, two independent observers measured the distances from the fibular head, the medial and lateral epicondyle, and the adductor tubercle to the JL. A two-sided p value of \u22640.05 was considered statistically significant. \n Two hundred knees of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) were examined.

Case studies suggest a positive effect of cervical spine treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST, but no experimental studies are available. \n To investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on tinnitus complaints in patients with CST. \n Randomized controlled trial. \n Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI): 25-90 points) and neck complaints (Neck Bournemouth Questionnaire (NBQ)\u00a0>\u00a014 points). \n All patients received cervical physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an immediate-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a019). \n TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring moments, except at baseline. \n In all patients (n\u00a0=\u00a038) TFI and NBQ-scores decreased significantly after treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate how those groups compared with healthy subjects. \n We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes. \n The total non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of sputum macrophages and epithelial cells.

This study therefore prospectively assesses the impact of position emission tomography scanning on the management of primary rectal cancer. \n Forty-six patients with advanced primary rectal cancer referred for consideration of adjuvant preoperative therapy underwent position emission tomography scanning. The referring physicians prospectively recorded each patient's stage following conventional imaging and the proposed treatment plan prior to position emission tomography scanning. This was then compared with subsequent stage and actual management implemented, and the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced changes was noted by subsequent clinical follow-up. \n The surgical management of 36 of 46 patients (78 percent) was unchanged as a result of position emission tomography, even though position emission tomography upstaged disease in 3 of 36 cases (8 percent) and downstaged disease in 5 of 36 cases (14 percent). In 8 of 46 cases (17 percent), management was altered because of the position emission tomography scan findings, including 6 cases (13 percent) in which surgery was cancelled and 2 other cases (4 percent) in which the radiotherapy field was changed.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: One of the problems with manual resuscitators is the difficulty in achieving accurate volume delivery. The volume delivered to the patient varies by the physical characteristics of the person and method. This study was designed to compare tidal volumes delivered by the squeezing method, physical characteristics and education and practice levels. \n 114 individuals trained in basic life support and bag-valve-mask ventilation participated in this study. Individual characteristics were obtained by the observer and the education and practice level were described by the subjects. Ventilation was delivered with a manual resuscitator connected to a microspirometer and volumes were measured. Subjects completed three procedures: one-handed, two-handed and two-handed half-compression. \n The mean (standard deviation) volumes for the one-handed method were 592.84 ml (SD 117.39), two-handed 644.24 ml (SD 144.7) and two-handed half-compression 458.31 ml (SD 120.91) (p<0.01). Tidal volume delivered by two hands was significantly greater than that delivered by one hand (r = 0.398, p<0.01). The physical aspects including hand size, volume and grip power had no correlation with the volume delivered. There were slight increases in tidal volume with education and practice, but correlation was weak (r = 0.213, r = 0.281, r = 0.131, p<0.01). \n Can you deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitator?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe volume delivered to the patient varies by the physical characteristics of the person and method.\nSo, we can say that the physical aspects including hand size, volume and grip power had no correlation with the volume delivered.\nThere were slight increases in tidal volume with education and practice, but correlation was weak.\nSo, we can say that the mean (standard deviation) volumes for the one-handed method were 592.84 ml (SD 1",
    "Let's think step by step. VLEM are a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: We observed an endoscopic abnormally in a group of children with histological esophagitis. We termed this finding \"vertical lines in esophageal mucosa\" (VLEM). We examined the relationship between the presence of VLEM and significant histologic changes in esophageal mucosal biopsies. \n Between January 1, 1992, and August 31, 1994, the senior author (JFF) performed 255 esophageal biopsies. The procedure reports, available endoscopic photographs, and histology reports were reviewed to establish the endoscopic and histologic appearance of the esophageal mucosa. Intraepithelial cells were counted in a blind review of 42 randomly selected biopsies. \n The esophageal mucosa had a normal appearance on 160 endoscopic studies (Group 1) and VLEM were the only mucosal abnormalities in 41 endoscopies (Group 2). Histology was normal in 92 of 160 biopsies (57.5%) from Group 1, and 1 of 41 biopsies (2.4%) from Group 2. Most patients in Group 2 had eosinophilic esophagitis (34 of 41, 83%, specificity 0.85, sensitivity 0.5, p>0.001) which was of moderate to severe intensity (31 of 34, 91.2%, specificity 0.88, sensitivity 0.73, p<0.001). \n Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe presence of VLEM on endoscopy is a marker for esophageal mucosal abnormalities.\nVLEM are present in 57.5% of normal esophageal mucosa and in 2.4% of esophagitis.\nVLEM are present in 83% of eosinophilic esophagitis.\nVLEM are not present in 100% of e",

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Hypoglycaemia caused by glucose-lowering therapy has been linked to cardiovascular (CV) events. The ORIGIN trial provides an opportunity to further assess this relationship. \n A total of 12 537 participants with dysglycaemia and high CV-risk were randomized to basal insulin glargine titrated to a fasting glucose of \u2264 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) or standard glycaemic care. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was defined as symptoms confirmed by glucose \u2264 54 mg/dL and severe hypoglycaemia as a requirement for assistance or glucose \u2264 36 mg/dL. Outcomes were: (i) the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke; (ii) mortality; (iii) CV mortality; and (iv) arrhythmic death. Hazards were estimated before and after adjustment for a hypoglycaemia propensity score. During a median of 6.2 years (IQR: 5.8-6.7), non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 41.7 and 14.4% glargine and standard group participants, respectively, while severe episodes occurred in 5.7 and 1.8%, respectively. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was not associated with any outcome following adjustment. Conversely, severe hypoglycaemia was associated with a greater risk for the primary outcome (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.24-2.02, P<0.001), mortality (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.19, P<0.001), CV death (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.27-2.30, P<0.001) and arrhythmic death (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.17-2.67, P = 0.007). Similar findings were noted for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia for the primary outcome and mortality. The severe hypoglycaemia hazard for all four outcomes was higher with standard care than with insulin glargine. \n Does hypoglycaemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nThe study was ORIGIN trial and it was done on people with diabetes who were at high risk of CV events.\nThe study was a randomized, double-blind trial.\nThe study was done on 12537 patients.\nThe study was done on patients with dysglycaemia.\nThe study was done on patients with high CV risk.\nThe study was done on patients with dysglycaemia and high CV risk.",

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: To explore whether electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can help improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet autoantibody-positive population. \n TrialNet subjects who were positive for one or more autoantibodies (microinsulin autoantibody, GAD65 autoantibody [GADA], IA-2A, and ZnT8A) with available ECL-insulin autoantibody (IAA) and ECL-GADA data at their initial visit were analyzed; after a median follow-up of 24 months, 177 of these 1,287 subjects developed diabetes. \n Univariate analyses showed that autoantibodies by radioimmunoassays (RIAs), ECL-IAA, ECL-GADA, age, sex, number of positive autoantibodies, presence of HLA DR3/4-DQ8 genotype, HbA1c, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measurements were all significantly associated with progression to diabetes. Subjects who were ECL positive had a risk of progression to diabetes within 6 years of 58% compared with 5% for the ECL-negative subjects (P<0.0001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were compared, with the base model including age, sex, OGTT measurements, and number of positive autoantibodies by RIAs. The model with positivity for ECL-GADA and/or ECL-IAA was the best, and factors that remained significantly associated with time to diabetes were area under the curve (AUC) C-peptide, fasting C-peptide, AUC glucose, number of positive autoantibodies by RIAs, and ECL positivity. Adding ECL to the Diabetes Prevention Trial risk score (DPTRS) improved the receiver operating characteristic curves with AUC of 0.83 (P<0.0001). \n Do Electrochemiluminescence Assays Improve Prediction of Time to Type 1 Diabetes in Autoantibody-Positive TrialNet Subjects?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nWe have a data set of 1,287 subjects with one or more autoantibodies (microinsulin autoantibody, GAD65 autoantibody [GADA], IA-2A, and ZnT8A) with available ECL-insulin autoantibody (IAA) and ECL-GADA data at their initial visit. \n177 of these 1,2",

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Little is known about the validity and reliability of expert assessments of the quality of antimicrobial prescribing, despite their importance in antimicrobial stewardship. We investigated how infectious disease doctors' assessments compared with a reference standard (modal expert opinion) and with the assessments of their colleagues. \n Twenty-four doctors specialized in infectious diseases or clinical microbiology (16 specialists and 8 residents) from five hospitals were asked to assess the appropriateness of antimicrobial agents prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications in 56 paper cases. They were instructed how to handle guideline applicability and deviations. We created a reference standard of antimicrobial appropriateness using the modal assessment of 16 specialists. We calculated criterion validity and interrater and intrarater overall and specific agreement with an index expert (senior infectious disease physician) and analysed the influence of doctor characteristics on validity. \n Specialists agreed with the reference standard in 80% of cases (range 75%-86%), with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 84%, respectively.

All patients were treated with curative intent to a mean dose of 65 Gy. The full history of any metastatic disease was documented for each subject, including the initial site of involvement, any progression over time, and patient survival. \n The overall survival rate for the 369 patients was 75% at 5 years and 45% at 10 years. The overall survival rate of patients who never developed metastases was 90% and 81% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. However, among the 74 patients (20%) who developed metastases, the survival rate at both 5 and 10 years was significantly reduced (p<0.0001). The overall survival rate for patients who developed bone metastases was 58% and 27% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and patients with bone metastases to the pelvis fared worse compared with those with vertebral metastases. With regard to the metastatic number, patients with<or =5 metastatic lesions had superior survival rates relative to those with>5 lesions (73% and 36% at 5 and 10 years vs. 45% and 18% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; p = 0.02).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasonographic screening for primary hepatocellular carcinoma. \n A total of 680 eligible cases were classified into three groups (surveillance, opportunistic, and symptomatic groups) according to their initial exposure. We used survival time, tumor morphology, and T staging as prognostic outcomes. The outcomes of screened/unscreened and sur veillance/nonsur veillance were compared with the use of the logistic regression model. \n The adjusted odds ratios for the screened group versus the unscreened group, with 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival time being used as outcomes, were 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.52), 0.33 (95% CI, 0.21-0.53), and 0.37 (95% CI, 0.23-0.61), respectively.

Thus, the answer is (c) maybe\n\nQ: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy afflicting women, and the most common cancer overall in Jordan. A woman's decision to go for screening is influenced by her social support network. This study aims to explore Jordanian men's individual and contextual perspectives on women's breast cancer and their own role in the breast health of the females within their families. \n An explorative qualitative design was used to purposively recruit 24 married men aged 27 to 65\u00a0years (median 43\u00a0years) from four governorates in Jordan. Data in the form of interviews transcriptions was subjected to qualitative content analysis. \n Three themes were identified: a) Supporting one's wife; b) Marital needs and obligations; c) Constrained by a culture of destiny and shame. The first theme was built on men's feelings of responsibility for the family's health and well-being, their experiences of encouraging their wives to seek health care and their providing counselling and instrumental support. The second theme emerged from men's views about other men's rejection of a wife inflicted by breast cancer, their own perceptions of diminished femininity due to mastectomy and their own concerns about protecting the family from the hereditary risk of breast cancer. The third theme was seen in men's perception of breast cancer as an inevitable act of God that is far away from one's own family, in associating breast cancer with improper behaviour and in their readiness to face the culture of Eib (shame). \n \"Would a man smell a rose then throw it away?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n(a) The man would not smell the rose.\n(b) The man would not throw the rose away.\n(c) The man would not throw the rose away, but he would not smell it either.\nOption (c) is the right answer.\n###\n# 10.3\n# A young boy in a village in India is asked to pick the largest of three apples from a tree.

We compared government records and self-reports of motor vehicle collisions and driving convictions in a sample of stroke survivors. \n The 56 participants were originally recruited for a prospective study on driving and community re-integration post-stroke; the study population consisted of moderately impaired stroke survivors without severe communication disorders who had been referred for a driving assessment. The driving records of the 56 participants for the 5 years before study entry and the 1-year study period were acquired with written consent from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), Canada. Self-reports of collisions and convictions were acquired via a semistructured interview and then compared with the MTO records. \n Forty-three participants completed the study. For 7 (13.5%) the MTO records did not match the self-reports regarding collision involvement, and for 9 (17.3%) the MTO records did not match self-reports regarding driving convictions. The kappa coefficient for the correlation between MTO records and self-reports was 0.52 for collisions and 0.47 for convictions (both in the moderate range of agreement).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Epidemiologic studies have suggested that hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance are related to the development of colon cancer. Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up. \n Our population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification. \n Development of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07). A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up.

Multivariate analysis provided beta1Gly49 homozygotes with higher risk for TTN (OR 18.5; 95%CI 1.5-229; p = 0.023) than beta1Ser49 allele carrier. Further analysis showed significant association of T-47C, A46G, C79G and C491T (TACC) haplotype in ADRB2 gene with TTN (p = 0.048). \n Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN): a role for polymorphisms in the beta-adrenergic receptor (ADRB) encoding genes?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nFirst of all, we have to check whether the TTN is really a disease.\nWe have to look at the data of the paper.\nFrom the paper we can see that the TTN infants were more likely to be male, had a lower mean birthweight and gestational age and were more often delivered by caesarean section.\nThese data show that the TTN infants are different from the control group in terms of gender, birthweight,",
    "Let's think step by step. Maybe, somatic complaints were a somewhat less powerful predictor than income and age. Thus, the answer is (c) maybe\n\nQ: Evidence suggests substantial comorbidity between symptoms of somatization and depression in clinical as well as nonclinical populations. However, as most existing research has been retrospective or cross-sectional in design, very little is known about the specific nature of this relationship. In particular, it is unclear whether somatic complaints may heighten the risk for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms. \n We report findings on the link between symptoms of somatization (assessed using the SCL-90-R) and depression 5 years later (assessed using the CES-D) in an initially healthy cohort of community adults, based on prospective data from the RENO Diet-Heart Study. \n Gender-stratified multiple regression analyses revealed that baseline CES-D scores were the best predictors of subsequent depressive symptoms for men and women. Baseline scores on the SCL-90-R somatization subscale significantly predicted subsequent self-reported symptoms of depressed mood 5 years later, but only in women. However, somatic complaints were a somewhat less powerful predictor than income and age. \n Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nWe have a sample of initially healthy community adults.\nWe have prospective data.\nWe have baseline data on symptoms of somatization (SCL-90-R) and depression (CES-D).\nWe have 5 years of follow-up data on depression.\nWe have gender-stratified multiple regression analyses.\nWe have baseline CES-D scores as the best predictors of subsequent depressive sympt",
    "Let's think step by step. No, the data linkage methodology used in this study is not suitable for health outcomes research. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant. \n Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression. \n From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%. \n Are women with major depression in pregnancy identifiable in population health data?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nWe have 96698 births in WA.\nAt least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women.\nThere were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy.\nThere were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified",
    "Let's think step by step. Yes, remote postischemic conditioning reduces the myocardial lesions that are associated with PCI. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Myocardial damage that is associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) partially affects the results of the procedure, and is related to medium-term cardiovascular death. Remote postischemic conditioning might reduce the myocardial lesions that are associated with PCI, but perhaps less so in diabetics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of remote postischemic conditioning in patients undergoing elective PCI for stable angina or non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome with troponin<1 ng/ml at the time of randomization. \n This randomized single-blinded single-center clinical trial involved 320 patients undergoing elective PCI who were randomized to either receive three 5-min cycles of ischemia by inflation of a cuff on the non-dominant arm to 200 mm Hg (remote postischemic conditioning) or to placebo (uninflated cuff). The primary outcome variable was the maximum increase in troponin in the first 24 h. The secondary outcome variable was readmission due to heart failure or cardiovascular mortality after 1 year of follow-up.

    "Let's think step by step. No, the mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was not statistically significant. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Combining various antiretroviral agents into one single dosage form has been a strategy to reduce pill burden and enhance medication adherence among human immunodeficiency virus /AIDS (HIV/AIDS) patients. \n This is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy. \n The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique. \n Nine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold. \n Does combining antiretroviral agents in a single dosage form enhance quality of life of HIV/AIDS patients?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe study design is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective.\nThe researchers matched 1:1 patients from the FXD group with the FRC group using propensity scores.\nThe study population was HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 active antiretroviral medications.\nThe researchers used the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) to identify HIV/AIDS patients with",

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Disorders of consciousness (DOC) diagnosis relies on the presence or absence of purposeful motor responsiveness, which characterizes the minimally conscious state (MCS) and the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), respectively. Functional neuroimaging studies have raised the question of possible residual conscious awareness also in clinically-defined UWS patients. The aim of our study was to identify electrophysiological parameters, by means of a transcranial magnetic stimulation approach, which might potentially express the presence of residual networks sustaining fragmentary behavioral patterns, even when no conscious behavior can be observed. \n We enrolled 25 severe DOC patients, following post-anoxic or traumatic brain injury and 20 healthy individuals (HC) as control group. Baseline electrophysiological evaluation evidenced, in comparison to HC, a partial preservation of cortical effective connectivity and excitability in clinically defined MCS, whereas these components were absent in clinically defined UWS. Then, we applied an anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) protocol over the orbitofrontal cortex. \n a-tDCS was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all HC, MCS, and to unmask such excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients. \n Can transcranial direct current stimulation be useful in differentiating unresponsive wakefulness syndrome from minimally conscious state patients?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nWhat is the question?\nDisorders of consciousness (DOC) diagnosis relies on the presence or absence of purposeful motor responsiveness, which characterizes the minimally conscious state (MCS) and the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), respectively.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are an effective treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. However, patients receiving AIs report a higher incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fractures; the mechanism and risk factors for this correlation are not well studied. The aim of this study was to correlate these musculoskeletal symptoms and bone fractures in patients receiving AIs with bone mineral density (BMD), previous tamoxifen use, and administration of calcium/bisphosphonate (Ca/Bis). \n We reviewed charts of 856 patients with hormone receptor-positive nonmetastatic breast cancer seen at our institution between January 1999 and October 2007. A total of 316 patients met the inclusion criteria of treatment with one of the AIs for>or = 3 months and availability of a dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) during this treatment. Arthralgia, generalized bone pain and/or myalgia, bone fracture after beginning AIs, any tamoxifen treatment, and Ca/Bis therapy were recorded. \n Our study demonstrates a significant association between symptoms and DEXA-BMD results (P<.001). Similarly, the group receiving tamoxifen before AIs had fewer patients with arthralgia or generalized bone pain/myalgia or bone fracture (P<.001). Furthermore, the group receiving AIs plus Ca/Bis had more patients without musculoskeletal symptoms and had fewer fractures. Finally, the group receiving steroidal AIs compared with nonsteroidal AIs had more patients with arthralgia or generalized bone pain and/or myalgia, and bone fractures (P<.001). \n Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nAromatase inhibitors (AIs) are an effective treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

Thus, the answer is (c) maybe\n\nQ: To determine current practice and to assess the value of routine follow-up procedures for endometrial cancer surveillance. To discuss whether such procedures are feasible and effective to identify asymptomatic recurrences and describe the pattern of relapse detected by procedures. \n The records of 282 consecutive women with recurrent endometrial cancer treated from 1986 to 2005 were retrospectively collected in 8 Italian institutions. Primary disease, clinical history, and recurrence features and data were analyzed. \n Thirty-five (12.4%) of 282 patients had recurrence in vaginal vault, 51 patients (18.0%) had recurrence in central pelvis, 14 patients (4.9%) had recurrence in pelvic wall, and 39 patients (13.8%) had recurrence in lymph nodes. One-hundred twenty-eight patients (45.3%) showed a distant relapse, whereas 15 patients (5.3%) developed both distant relapse and local relapse. The site of relapse influenced survival because the patients with vaginal vault recurrences lived significantly longer than the patients with recurrences in other sites. Eighty (28.4%) of the 282 patients became symptomatic and anticipated the scheduled visit, 37 (13.1 %) of the patients reported their symptoms during the follow-up meeting, and 165 (58.5 %) of the patients were asymptomatic and the diagnostic path was introduced by a planned visit or examination. Among the asymptomatic patients, the first procedure that led to further examinations was clinical visit alone for 60 (36.4%) of 165 patients, imaging for 103 patients (62.4%), and cytologic examination for 2 patients (1.2%). Symptoms at recurrence can predict survival: patients with an asymptomatic recurrence had a median survival time from relapse of 35 months versus 13 months if they had a symptomatic repetition (P = 0.0001). \n Could different follow-up modalities play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe first step is to define what is a recurrence.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: To clarify whether horizontal canal ocular reflex is influenced by otolith organs input. \n The subjects were seven healthy humans. The right ear was stimulated using ice-water. Each subject was kept in a left-ear-down position for 20 s and then repositioned to a prone position, a right-ear-down position and a supine position with 20 s intervals. Nystagmus was analysed using three-dimensional video-oculography. \n Eye movements in the supine position and the prone position were not in a symmetric fashion. Nystagmus in the left-ear-down position and the right-ear-down position were not symmetric either. These phenomena indicate that the axis of the eyeball rotation was affected by the shift of the direction of gravity exerted on the head. \n Is horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex influenced by otolith organs input?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nWhen the head is in the supine position, the gravity acts on the head and the eyeball in the same direction.

Appropriate citations were also extracted from a manual search of the bibliographies of selected papers. \n Twenty-three articles were retrieved. Only 4 presented original data including comparisons to a nonexposed control group and they form the basis for this study. \n Because the raw data or specific techniques of data analysis were not always explicitly described, indices of risk for exposure were extracted from the data as presented and were analysed without attempting to convert them to a common measure. \n Articles were assessed according to the criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group for evaluating articles on harm. Review of the literature yielded estimates of the risk of adverse fertility outcomes ranging from 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 2.5) for ectopic pregnancy after an appendectomy to 4.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 14.9) for tubal infertility from perforation of the appendix.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: This study sought to evaluate mutations in genes encoding the slow component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Ks)) channel in familial atrial fibrillation (AF). \n Although AF can have a genetic etiology, links between inherited gene defects and acquired factors such as atrial stretch have not been explored. \n Mutation screening of the KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, and KCNE3 genes was performed in 50 families with AF. The effects of mutant protein on cardiac I(Ks) activation were evaluated using electrophysiological studies and human atrial action potential modeling. \n One missense KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, was identified in 1 family with a high prevalence of hypertension. Atrial fibrillation was present only in older individuals who had developed atrial dilation and who were genotype positive. Patch-clamp studies of wild-type or R14C KCNQ1 expressed with KCNE1 in CHO cells showed no statistically significant differences between wild-type and mutant channel kinetics at baseline, or after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. After exposure to hypotonic solution to elicit cell swelling/stretch, mutant channels showed a marked increase in current, a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action potential duration. \n Stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation A link between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n(a) yes:\nYes, because it is a mutation.\n(b) no:\nNo, because the mutation was not linked to atrial fibrillation.\n(c) maybe:\nMaybe, because the mutation was linked to atrial fibrillation.\nIn this case, the answer is a.\n# 12.3\n# How many genes are there?\nQuestion:\nHow many genes are there in",

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, rural residence is associated with a higher mortality rate. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Patients living in rural areas may be at a disadvantage in accessing tertiary health care.AIM: To test the hypothesis that very premature infants born to mothers residing in rural areas have poorer outcomes than those residing in urban areas in the state of New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) despite a coordinated referral and transport system. \n \"Rural\" or \"urban\" status was based on the location of maternal residence. Perinatal characteristics, major morbidity and case mix adjusted mortality were compared between 1879 rural and 6775 urban infants<32 weeks gestational age, born in 1992-2002 and admitted to all 10 neonatal intensive care units in NSW and ACT. \n Rural mothers were more likely to be teenaged, indigenous, and to have had a previous premature birth, prolonged ruptured membrane, and antenatal corticosteroid. Urban mothers were more likely to have had assisted conception and a caesarean section. More urban (93% v 83%) infants were born in a tertiary obstetric hospital. Infants of rural residence had a higher mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.48, p = 0.005). This trend was consistently seen in all subgroups and significantly for the tertiary hospital born population and the 30-31 weeks gestation subgroup.

Moreover, a strategic use of PMS has been found to enhance quality, compared to non-strategic use, although a clear understanding of this linkage is still to be achieved. This paper deals with the test of direct and indirect models related to the link between the strategic use of PMS and the level of improved processes in health care organizations.

Since paracervical anaesthesia may be useful during this procedure, we investigated in this prospective randomised study its impact on the clinical course of abortion and pain especially in the late first and second stage of labour. \n 20 women scheduled for elective abortion (fetal reasons) between the 16th and 23rd week of gestation were to be given 1 mg gemeprost vaginally every 6 hours. They were allocated at random: 10 women received only Pethidin intravenously and Butylscopolamine rectally, another 10 women were additionally treated by paracervical anaesthesia (2 x 10 ml 0.5% Bupivacain solution) at a cervical dilatation of 2-3 cm. \n A median of 3 gemeprost applications were administered in both groups. In the group without paracervical anaesthesia the median induction to abortion interval was 20 hours (range: 8-44 hours), 13 hours (range: 8-36 hours, NS) resulting for the paracervical anaesthesia group. The intervals from the last application of prostaglandin until abortion and from 3 cm cervical dilatation to abortion were slightly, but not significantly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group.

    "Let's think step by step. Insulin resistance is associated with CVD risk, but not with body fat percentage. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Several studies have shown associations between hyperglycemia and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, yet glucose-lowering treatment does little to mitigate this risk. We examined whether associations between hyperglycemia and CVD risk were explained by underlying insulin resistance. \n In 60 middle-aged individuals without diabetes we studied the associations of fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour post oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity as well as body fat percentage with CVD risk. Insulin sensitivity was measured as the glucose infusion rate during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, body fat percentage was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry, and CVD risk was estimated using the Framingham risk score. Associations of fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity and body fat percentage with the Framingham risk score were assessed in linear regression models. \n Both fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose levels were associated with higher Framingham risk score (fasting glucose: r(2) = 0.21; 2-hour glucose: r(2) = 0.24; P<0.001 for both), and insulin sensitivity with lower Framingham risk score (r(2) = 0.36; P<0.001). However, adjustment for insulin sensitivity and 2-hour glucose made the effect of fasting glucose non-significant (P = 0.060). Likewise, when adjusting for insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose, the association between 2-hour glucose and Framingham risk score disappeared (P = 0.143). In contrast, insulin sensitivity was still associated with Framingham risk score after adjusting for glucose levels (P<0.001). Body fat was not associated with Framingham risk score when taking insulin sensitivity into account (P = 0.550). \n Does insulin resistance drive the association between hyperglycemia and cardiovascular risk?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nInsulin resistance is associated with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance is associated with CVD.\nIf hyperglycemia is associated with CVD risk, then this association is explained by insulin resistance.\nIf insulin resistance is associated with CVD risk, then this association is explained by hyperglycemia.\nTherefore, hyperglycemia is associated with CVD risk, which is explained by insulin resistance.\nSo, we",

Conventional screening criteria are too limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction where a transplantation is possible. \n Fifty-five potential brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%. \n Of the 55 potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died: 2 from hemorrhage (FAC>50% in donors); 1 from right and one from left ventricular dysfunction (FAC<50% in donors). The FAC increased significantly from 51 +/- 15% to 57 +/- 11% in 18 hearts that underwent TEE in donors and afterwards in recipients.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: The use of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound may help to determine the exact position of the needle during breast biopsy, thereby reducing the number of core samples that are needed to achieve a reliable histological diagnosis. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of 3D ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy (LCNB) of the breast. \n A total of 360 core needle biopsies was obtained from 169 breast lesions in 146 patients. Additional open breast biopsy was performed in 111 women (127/169 breast lesions); the remaining 42 lesions were followed up for at least 24 months. 3D ultrasound visualization of the needle in the postfiring position was used to classify the biopsy as central, marginal or outside the lesion. Based on this classification it was decided whether another sample had to be obtained. \n A median of two core samples per lesion provided for all the lesions a sensitivity for malignancy of 96.9%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0% and false-negative rate of 3.1%, and for the excised lesions a sensitivity of 96.5%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0%, false-negative rate of 3.5% and an underestimation rate of 3.4%. \n Three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy: is it a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe use of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound may help to determine the exact position of the needle during breast biopsy, thereby reducing the number of core samples that are needed to achieve a reliable histological diagnosis.\nThe aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of 3D ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy (LCNB) of the breast.\nA total of 360 core needle bi",

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: The proper angle of miniscrew insertion is important for cortical anchorage, patient safety, and biomechanical control. The purposes of this study are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or types of malocclusion. \n In this retrospective study, 100 individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of variance for repeated measures was used. \n The sample was composed of 100 patients with a mean age of 17.4 \u00b1 6.74 years. There were 61 female and 39 male patients and 60 Class I and 40 Class II molar relationships. The inter-radicular space ranged from 2.46 to 3.31 mm, and alveolar bone thickness ranged from 8.01 to 13.77 mm.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Several studies have suggested a protective effect of folic acid (FA) on congenital heart anomalies. Down syndrome (DS) infants are known to have a high frequency of heart anomalies. Not all children with DS suffer from heart anomalies, which raises the question whether maternal factors might affect the risk of these anomalies. Our objectives were to investigate whether first-trimester FA use protects against heart anomalies among DS children. \n Women with liveborn DS children participating in the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study between 1976 and 1997 were included. We performed case-control analyses using DS, with heart anomalies as cases and DS, without heart anomalies as controls. Subanalyses were performed for defects that have been associated with FA in non-DS populations (conotruncal, ventricular septal [VSD]) and for those that are associated with DS (ostium secundum type atrial septal defects [ASD]and endocardial cushion defects [ECD]). Exposure was defined as the use of any FA-containing product for an average of at least 4 days per week during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, whereas no exposure was defined as no use of FA in these 12 weeks. \n Of the 223 cases, 110 (49%) were exposed versus 84 (46%) of the 184 controls.

Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53\u00b0 of sagittal rotation). The contact surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans. \n At 1 year the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation was 1.3\u00b0 (range, 0.1\u00b0-7.4\u00b0). Three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively.

It often mimics a gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), and may coexist with GBC, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. Furthermore, the premalignant nature of this entity is not known. This study was undertaken to assess the p53, PCNA and beta-catenin expression in XGC in comparison to GBC and chronic inflammation. \n Sections from paraffin-embedded blocks of surgically resected specimens of GBC (69 cases), XGC (65), chronic cholecystitis (18) and control gallbladder (10) were stained with the monoclonal antibodies to p53 and PCNA, and a polyclonal antibody to beta-catenin. p53 expression was scored as the percentage of nuclei stained. PCNA expression was scored as the product of the percentage of nuclei stained and the intensity of the staining (1-3). A cut-off value of 80 for this score was taken as a positive result. Beta-catenin expression was scored as type of expression-membranous, cytoplasmic or nuclear staining. \n p53 mutation was positive in 52% of GBC cases and 3% of XGC, but was not expressed in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. p53 expression was lower in XGC than in GBC (P<0.0001). PCNA expression was seen in 65% of GBC cases and 11% of XGC, but not in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. PCNA expression was higher in GBC than XGC (P=0.0001), but there was no significant difference between the XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladder groups. Beta-catenin expression was positive in the GBC, XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladder groups.

For a BMI greater than 23, the Singapore equation reached an accuracy rate of 76 %. Cross-validation proved an accuracy rate of 80 %. Estimation of basal metabolic rate in Chinese: are the current prediction equations applicable? Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Measurement of basal metabolic rate (BMR) is suggested as a tool to estimate energy requirements. Therefore, BMR prediction equations have been developed in multiple populations because indirect calorimetry is not always feasible. However, there is a paucity of data on BMR measured in overweight and obese adults living in Asia and equations developed for this group of interest. The aim of this study was to develop a new BMR prediction equation for Chinese adults applicable for a large BMI range and compare it with commonly used prediction equations. \n Subjects were 121 men and 111 women (age: 21-67 years, BMI: 16-41\u00a0kg/m(2)). Height, weight, and BMR were measured. Continuous open-circuit indirect calorimetry using a ventilated hood system for 30\u00a0min was used to measure BMR. A regression equation was derived using stepwise regression and accuracy was compared to 6 existing equations (Harris-Benedict, Henry, Liu, Yang, Owen and Mifflin). Additionally, the newly derived equation was cross-validated in a separate group of 70 Chinese subjects (26 men and 44 women, age: 21-69 years, BMI: 17-39\u00a0kg/m(2)). \n The equation developed from our data was: BMR (kJ/d)\u2009=\u200952.6 x weight (kg)\u2009+\u2009828 x gender\u2009+\u20091960 (women\u2009=\u20090, men\u2009=\u20091; R(2)\u2009=\u20090.81). The accuracy rate (within 10\u00a0% accurate) was 78\u00a0% which compared well to Owen (70\u00a0%), Henry (67\u00a0%), Mifflin (67\u00a0%), Liu (58\u00a0%), Harris-Benedict (45\u00a0%) and Yang (37\u00a0%) for the whole range of BMI.

In seasonal breeding species such as sheep, the circadian clock controls the secretion of an endogenous rhythm of melatonin and, as a consequence, is probably involved in the generation of seasonal rhythms of reproduction. Considering this, we identified the presence of the subunits of AMPK in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in the pre- and post-pineal pathways that control seasonality of reproduction in the ewe and we investigated if the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of two activators of AMPK, metformin and AICAR, affected the circadian rhythm of melatonin in ewes that were housed in constant darkness. In parallel the secretion of insulin was monitored as a peripheral metabolic marker. We also investigated the effects of i.c.v.

Angiotensin-II antagonists, triptans, selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 antagonists and esomeprazol were used in the assessment. As indicators of new drug uptake, we used adoption time, cumulative incidence, preference proportion, incidence rate and prescription cost and volume. For each measure, we ranked the general practices. Ranks were pair-wise plotted, and Pearson's correlation coefficient ( r) was calculated. Next, we analysed the correlation between ranks across different drug classes. \n For all indicators, the general practitioners' adoption of one group of drugs was poorly associated with adoption of others ( r</=0.49), indicating that early adoption of one type of drugs is not associated with early adoption of another. For all drug groups, adoption time adjusted for practice size was only weakly associated with other indicators ( r: -0.56 to -0.27).

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, improvements in clinical services are associated with reductions in under-five mortality rates. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: There are three main service delivery channels: clinical services, outreach, and family and community. To determine which delivery channels are associated with the greatest reductions in under-5 mortality rates (U5MR), we used data from sequential population-based surveys to examine the correlation between changes in coverage of clinical, outreach, and family and community services and in U5MR for 27 high-burden countries. \n Household survey data were abstracted from serial surveys in 27 countries. Average annual changes (AAC) between the most recent and penultimate survey were calculated for under-five mortality rates and for 22 variables in the domains of clinical, outreach, and family- and community-based services. For all 27 countries and a subset of 19 African countries, we conducted principal component analysis to reduce the variables into a few components in each domain and applied linear regression to assess the correlation between changes in the principal components and changes in under-five mortality rates after controlling for multiple potential confounding factors. \n AAC in under 5-mortality varied from 6.6% in Nepal to -0.9% in Kenya, with six of the 19 African countries all experiencing less than a 1% decline in mortality. The strongest correlation with reductions in U5MR was observed for access to clinical services (all countries: p = 0.02, r\u00b2 = 0.58; 19 African countries p<0.001, r\u00b2 = 0.67). For outreach activities, AAC U5MR was significantly correlated with antenatal care and family planning services, while AAC in immunization services showed no association. In the family- and community services domain, improvements in breastfeeding were associated with significant changes in mortality in the 30 countries but not in the African subset; while in the African countries, nutritional status improvements were associated with a significant decline in mortality. \n Do improvements in outreach, clinical, and family and community-based services predict improvements in child survival?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n1.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, spontaneous remission of clinical and biological symptoms occurred without the use of any immunosuppressive treatment. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic vasculitis involving mainly medium-sized arteries and, rarely, small-sized arteries. The diagnosis is principally based on clinical exams, biopsy of an affected organ, and/or arteriography of renal or mesenteric arteries. Once diagnosed, immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide, are generally introduced as soon as possible. Whether spontaneous remission of PAN occurs is therefore largely unknown. \n We describe the case of a 51-year-old woman who presented with a 4-day-history of intense pain in her left flank, hypertension, fever, microscopic hematuria, and acute renal failure. Contrast-enhanced renal ultrasound strongly suggested bilateral renal infarction. Medical history and an extensive workup allowed to exclude systemic embolism, recreational drug abuse, cardiac arrhythmias, and thrombophilia. A possible diagnosis of PAN was considered; however, within 2 weeks of admission, spontaneous remission of her clinical and biological symptoms occurred without the use of any immunosuppressive treatment. Finally, 3 months later, renal arteriography confirmed the diagnosis of PAN. The patient remains free of symptoms 1 year after initial presentation. \n Does spontaneous remission occur in polyarteritis nodosa?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nFirst, a patient with PAN has a high risk of death.\nSecond, the diagnosis of PAN is principally based on clinical exams, biopsy of an affected organ, and/or arteriography of renal or mesenteric arteries.\nThird, once diagnosed, immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide, are generally introduced as soon as possible.",

Thus, the answer is (c) maybe\n\nQ: Celiac disease (CD) is believed to be a permanent intolerance to gluten. A number of patients, however, discontinue the gluten-free diet (GFD) without developing symptoms or signs. The aim of our study was to investigate whether CD patients are capable of developing tolerance to gluten. \n All 77 adult patients from our hospital known to have biopsy-proven CD for more than 10 years were invited to participate. We investigated symptoms, gluten consumption, antibodies for CD and other autoimmunity, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typing, bone mineral density, and performed small bowel biopsies. Tolerance was defined as no immunological or histological signs of CD while consuming gluten. \n Sixty-six patients accepted participation, but after review of the diagnostic biopsies 53 were found to have true CD. Twenty-three percent of patients had a gluten-containing diet, 15% admitted gluten transgression and 62% followed the GFD. Patients on a GFD had significantly more osteoporosis. Normal small bowel mucosa was found in four of eight on gluten-containing diet and in four of four with gluten transgression. Two patients were considered to have developed tolerance to gluten.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Web search engines are an important tool in communication and diffusion of knowledge. Among these, Google appears to be the most popular one: in August 2008, it accounted for 87% of all web searches in the UK, compared with Yahoo's 3.3%. Google's value as a diagnostic guide in general medicine was recently reported. The aim of this comparative cross-sectional study was to evaluate whether searching Google with disease-related terms was effective in the identification and diagnosis of complex immunological and allergic cases. \n Forty-five case reports were randomly selected by an independent observer from peer-reviewed medical journals. Clinical data were presented separately to three investigators, blinded to the final diagnoses. Investigator A was a Consultant with an expert knowledge in Internal Medicine and Allergy (IM&A) and basic computing skills. Investigator B was a Registrar in IM&A. Investigator C was a Research Nurse. Both Investigators B and C were familiar with computers and search engines. For every clinical case presented, each investigator independently carried out an Internet search using Google to provide a final diagnosis. Their results were then compared with the published diagnoses. \n Correct diagnoses were provided in 30/45 (66%) cases, 39/45 (86%) cases, and in 29/45 (64%) cases by investigator A, B, and C, respectively.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Various factors contribute to the effective implementation of evidence-based treatments (EBTs). In this study, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) was administered in a Veterans Affairs (VA) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) specialty clinic in which training and supervision were provided following VA implementation guidelines. The aim was to (a) estimate the proportion of variability in outcome attributable to therapists and (b) identify characteristics of those therapists who produced better outcomes. \n We used an archival database of veterans (n = 192) who completed 12 sessions of CPT by therapists (n = 25) who were trained by 2 nationally recognized trainers, 1 of whom also provided weekly group supervision. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate therapist effects, with therapists treated as a random factor. The supervisor was asked to retrospectively rate each therapist in terms of perceived effectiveness based on supervision interactions. Using single case study design, the supervisor was interviewed to determine what criteria she used to rate the therapists and emerging themes were coded. \n When initial level of severity on the PTSD Checklist (PCL; McDonald&Calhoun, 2010; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska,&Keane, 1993) was taken into account, approximately 12% of the variability in the PCL at the end of treatment was due to therapists.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is the functional renal failure associated with advanced cirrhosis and has also been described in fulminant hepatic failure. Without liver transplantation its prognosis is dismal. Our study included patients with type 1 HRS associated with cirrhosis, who were not liver transplant candidates.AIM: To identify variables associated with improved survival. \n Sixty-eight patients fulfilled the revised Ascites Club Criteria for type 1 HRS. None of them was suitable for liver transplantation. All the patients were treated with combinations of: albumin, midodrine and octreotide, pressors, and hemodialysis. \n Median survival was 13 days for the whole group.

We, therefore, explored health behaviours and conventional risk factors of African individuals with optimal blood pressure (BP) (\u2264 120/80 mm Hg), and their 5-year prediction for the development of hypertension. \n The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology study in the North West Province, South Africa, started in 2005 and included African volunteers (n = 1994; aged>30 years) from a sample of 6000 randomly selected households in rural and urban areas. \n At baseline, 48% of the participants were hypertensive (\u2265 140/90 mmHg). Those with optimal BP (n = 478) were followed at a success rate of 70% for 5 years (213 normotensive, 68 hypertensive, 57 deceased). Africans that became hypertensive smoked more than the normotensive individuals (68.2% vs 49.8%), and they also had a greater waist circumference [ratio of geometric means of 0.94 cm (95% CI: 0.86-0.99)] and greater amount of \u03b3-glutamyltransferase [0.74 U/l (95% CI: 0.62-0.88)]at baseline.

All intubations performed in the control setting were placed correctly in the trachea; there were two (6.7%) esophageal intubations in the in-flight setting. The difference in appropriate endotracheal intubation between the two settings was not significant (chi 2 = 0.3; p>0.05). \n Is oral endotracheal intubation efficacy impaired in the helicopter environment?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe purpose of the study was to determine whether or not the in-flight environment of air medical transport in a BO-105 helicopter impairs the ability of flight nurses to perform oral endotracheal intubation.\nThe study was conducted in an MBB BO-105 helicopter.\nFlight nurses performed three manikin intubations in each of the two study environments: on an emergency department stret",

    "Let's think step by step. No, the number of follicles does not influence the ongoing pregnancy rate. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) with intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a common treatment in couples with unexplained non-conception. Induction of multifollicular growth is considered to improve pregnancy outcome, but it contains an increased risk of multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. In this study the impact of the number of follicles (>14 mm) on the ongoing pregnancy rate (PR) and multiple PR was evaluated in the first four treatment cycles. \n A retrospective cohort study was performed in all couples with unexplained non-conception undergoing COS-IUI in the Academic Hospital of Maastricht. The main outcome measure was ongoing PR. Secondary outcomes were ongoing multiple PR, number of follicles of>or=14 mm, and order of treatment cycle. \n Three hundred couples were included. No significant difference was found in ongoing PR between women with one, two, three or four follicles respectively (P=0.54), but in women with two or more follicles 12/73 pregnancies were multiples. Ongoing PR was highest in the first treatment cycle and declined significantly with increasing cycle order (P=0.006), while multiple PR did not change. \n Is controlled ovarian stimulation in intrauterine insemination an acceptable therapy in couples with unexplained non-conception in the perspective of multiple pregnancies?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nIf we assume that there is a significant difference in ongoing PR between women with one, two, three or four follicles, we would have to reject the null hypothesis.\nWe would have to reject the null hypothesis if the p-value is smaller than 0.05.\nIf the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we would have to reject the null hypothesis.\nBut the p-value is larger than 0.05.\n",

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: To assess the results of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease over a period of 18 years, and to determine if there are factors which will predict the outcome. \n Sixty-nine sequential patients treated surgically by a single surgeon in Newcastle upon Tyne between 1980 and 1997 were identified and data from 61 of these have been analysed. \n Retrospective analysis of outcome measures. \n Patients were divided into three groups (remission, failure and relapse) depending on the late outcome of their treatment as determined at the time of analysis, i.e. 88 months (median) years after surgery. Remission is defined as biochemical reversal of hypercortisolism with re-emergence of diurnal circadian rhythm, resolution of clinical features and adequate suppression on low-dose dexamethasone testing. Failure is defined as the absence of any of these features. Relapse is defined as the re-emergence of Cushing's disease more than one year after operation. Clinical features such as weight, sex, hypertension, associated endocrine disorders and smoking, biochemical studies including preoperative and postoperative serum cortisol, urine free cortisol, serum ACTH, radiological, histological and surgical findings were assessed in relation to these three groups to determine whether any factors could reliably predict failure or relapse after treatment. \n Of the 61 patients included in this study, 48 (78.7%) achieved initial remission and 13 (21.3%) failed treatment. Seven patients suffered subsequent relapse (range 22-158 months) in their condition after apparent remission, leaving a final group of 41 patients (67.2%) in the remission group. Tumour was identified at surgery in 52 patients, of whom 38 achieved remission. In comparison, only 3 of 9 patients in whom no tumour was identified achieved remission. This difference was significant (P = 0.048). When both radiological and histological findings were positive, the likelihood of achieving remission was significantly higher than if both modalities were negative (P = 0.038). There were significant differences between remission and failure groups when 2- and 6-week postoperative serum cortisol levels (P = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively) and 6-week postoperative urine free cortisol levels (P = 0.026) were compared. This allowed identification of patients who failed surgical treatment in the early postoperative period. Complications of surgery included transitory DI in 13, transitory CSF leak in 8 and transitory nasal discharge and cacosmia in 3.

Where possible, all patients had their ability to swallow assessed on the day of admission by both a doctor and a speech and language therapist using a standardized proforma. A videofluoroscopy examination was conducted within 3 days of admission. \n 94 patients underwent videofluoroscopy; 20 (21%) were seen to be aspirating, although this was not detected at the bedside in 10. In 18 (22%) of the patients the speech and language therapist considered the swallow to be unsafe. In the medical assessment, 39 patients (41%) had an unsafe swallow. Bedside assessment by a speech and language therapist gave a sensitivity of 47%, a specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 50% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 85% for the presence of aspiration.

In each session, directly after the stress or no-stress period, confederates and participants entered a bar laboratory where we observed their drinking behavior. Prior to entering the session, confederates were instructed to drink alcohol or soda. \n Participants in both stress and no-stress conditions consumed substantially more alcohol when confederates drank alcohol than when they drank soda.

Similarly, epiphysial growth relies on endochondral ossification from the circumferential secondary physeal [corrected]. injury can result in disruption of normal ossification. The cause of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) remains elusive. We hypothesized that juvenile OCD results from an insult affecting endochondral ossification from the secondary physis. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the MRI appearance of the distal femoral epiphysis-particularly the secondary physis-of children with juvenile OCD and to compare these findings with the MRI findings of unaffected children. \n Knee MRI examinations of 30 children (age range, 8 years 8 months to 13 years 4 months) with OCD and 30 matched control patients were evaluated for skeletal maturity; location of the OCD lesion, if present; secondary physeal [corrected] continuity; overlying chondroepiphysial integrity, contour, and width; signal intensity of subchondral bone; and secondary physeal [corrected]conspicuity. Variables were compared using chi-square tests. \n All children were skeletally immature. Condylar lesions were medial in 24 knees and lateral in six knees. All were in the middle one third, posterior one third, or middle and posterior thirds in the sagittal plane. The majority of lesions spanned the intercondylar and middle one third of the femoral condyle in the coronal plane (73%). There was a significant difference between secondary physeal [corrected] disruption in juvenile OCD condyles compared with unaffected condyles (p<0.001) and control condyles (p<0.001). Compared with unaffected and control condyles, the OCD group showed chondroepiphysial widening (p<0.001) and subchondral bone edema (p<0.001) on MRI.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Recent studies have demonstrated that statins have pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory effects and atrial fibrillation (AF) preventive effects. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of preoperative statin therapy in preventing AF after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). \n 221 patients underwent CABG in our hospital from 2004 to 2007. 14 patients with preoperative AF and 4 patients with concomitant valve surgery were excluded from this study. Patients were divided into two groups to examine the influence of statins: those with preoperative statin therapy (Statin group, n = 77) and those without it (Non-statin group, n = 126). In addition, patients were divided into two groups to determine the independent predictors for postoperative AF: those with postoperative AF (AF group, n = 54) and those without it (Non-AF group, n = 149). Patient data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. \n The overall incidence of postoperative AF was 26%. Postoperative AF was significantly lower in the Statin group compared with the Non-statin group (16% versus 33%, p = 0.005).

    "Let's think step by step. No, arterial catheter blood samples were contaminated with heparinase in the cup. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Arterial catheters are routinely used to sample blood for clotting studies in most cardiothoracic intensive care units. The clotting profile in surgical bleeding after cardiac surgery influences further management. Aspiration and discard of a certain amount of blood from the line, prior to sampling, are assumed to clear heparin contamination. We have investigated this assumption through analysis of the clotting profile by simultaneous arterial line and peripheral venous samples. \n The morning following cardiac surgery, simultaneous arterial line and peripheral venous blood samples were taken for activated plasma thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio and international normalized ratio (INR) in 49 randomly selected patients. Also, a thromboelastogram analysis (TEG) (n = 7) was made. A survey of 22 UK cardiothoracic intensive care units was carried out to determine the practice for the withdrawal of blood for clotting studies. \n The median arterial APTT ratio value was 1.32 +/- 0.52 as compared to the median peripheral APTT ratio value which was 1.1 +/- 0.24 (P<0.001). INR values were statistically similar by both routes. Heparin contamination was confirmed by TEG which revealed that the R-value for arterial catheter blood samples without heparinase in the cup was higher (406.00 +/- 64.44 s) compared with the value for arterial samples with heparinase in the cup (318.28 +/- 47.26s, P<0.05).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Most older drivers continue to drive as they age. To maintain safe and independent transport, mobility is important for all individuals, but especially for older drivers. \n The objective of this study was to investigate whether automatic transmission, compared with manual transmission, may improve the driving behavior of older drivers. \n In total, 31 older drivers (mean age 75.2 years) and 32 younger drivers - used as a control group (mean age 39.2 years) - were assessed twice on the same fixed route; once in a car with manual transmission and once in a car with automatic transmission. The cars were otherwise identical. The driving behavior was assessed with the Ryd On-Road Assessment driving protocol.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential use of a 3-phase bone scintigraphy method to determine the level of amputation on treatment cost, morbidity and mortality, reamputation rates, and the duration of hospitalization in diabetic foot. \n Thirty patients who were admitted to our clinic between September 2008 and July 2009, with diabetic foot were included. All patients were evaluated according to age, gender, diabetes duration, 3-phase bone scintigraphy, Doppler ultrasound, amputation/reamputation levels, and hospitalization periods. Patients underwent 3-phase bone scintigraphy using technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate, and the most distal site of the region displaying perfusion during the perfusion and early blood flow phase was marked as the amputation level.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: It has been suggested that increasing obesity levels in young women lead to intrauterine environments that, in turn, stimulate increased obesity among their offspring, generating an intergenerational acceleration of obesity levels. If this mechanism is important, the association of maternal body mass index (BMI) with offspring BMI should be stronger than the association of paternal with offspring BMI. \n To compare the relative strengths of association of maternal and paternal BMI with offspring BMI at age 7.5, taking into account the possible effect of non-paternity. \n We compared strength of association for maternal-offspring and paternal-offspring BMI for 4654 complete parent-offspring trios in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), using unstandardised and standardised regression analysis.

We carried out this research to investigate the need for dissection of station 9 lymph nodes during lung cancer surgery. \n Patients with primary lung cancer who underwent radical surgery between 2010 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical, pathologic, and prognosis data were obtained and analyzed. \n A total number of 1397 patients were included in this research. The metastasis rate of station 9 was 3.45%, which was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations. This metastasis rate was significantly correlated with pT stage, the lobe where the tumor was located, metastasis status of intrapulmonary lymph nodes, pTNM stage, and most of the other mediastinal lymph node stations. In males or ground glass opacity (GGO) patients, the metastasis of station 9 nodes was more unlikely to occur, even though there was no statistical significance.

After adjustment for living arrangements, the gender difference by marital status disappeared. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Men appear to benefit more from being married than women with respect to mortality in middle age. However, there is some uncertainty about gender differences in mortality risks in older individuals, widowed, divorced and single individuals and about the impact of living arrangements. \n Longitudinal data with 1990 census records being linked to mortality data up to 2005 were used (Swiss National Cohort). The sample comprised all residents over age 44 years in Switzerland (n=2,440,242). All-cause mortality HRs for marital status and living arrangements were estimated by Cox regression for men and women and different age groups with adjustment for education and socio-professional category. \n The benefit of being married was stronger for men than for women; however, mortality patterns were similar, with higher mortality in divorced and single individuals compared with widowed individuals (<80 years). After adjustment for living arrangements, the gender difference by marital status disappeared. Stratification by living arrangement revealed that mortality risks were highest for 45-64-year-old divorced (HR 1.72 (95% CI 1.67 to 1.76)) and single men (HR 1.67 (95% CI 1.63 to 1.71)) who lived alone. In women of the same age, the highest mortality risk was observed for those who were single and living with a partner (HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.82)).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Neuromedin U (NmU) is a neuropeptide with anorexigenic activity. Two receptor subtypes (NmUR1 and NmUR2) confer the effects of NmU on target cells. We have recently demonstrated that NmU reduces insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets. Aim of our current study is to investigate the role of somatostatin at mediating the effects of NmU on insulin secretion. \n Expression of NmU in the pancreas was detected by immunohistochemistry. Insulin and somatostatin secretion from in situ perfused rat pancreas and isolated pancreatic islets was measured by radioimmunoassay. The paracrine effects of somatostatin within pancreatic islets were blocked by cyclosomatostatin, a somatostatin receptor antagonist. \n Receptor subtype NmUR1, but not NmUR2, was expressed in the endocrine pancreas, predominantly in the periphery. Neuromedin U reduced insulin secretion from in situ perfused rat pancreas and stimulated somatostatin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets. Neuromedin U stimulated somatostatin secretion at both physiological and supraphysiological glucose concentrations.

Platelet counts from 318 first intrauterine transfusions in RhD alloimmunized pregnancies were used as controls. \n Fetal thrombocytopenia (platelet count<150 x 10(9)/l) was found in 4/42 (10%) in the Kell group and in 84/318 (26%) in the RhD group. None of the fetuses in the Kell alloimmunized pregnancies, including 15 with severe hydrops, had a clinically significant thrombocytopenia defined as a platelet count<50 x 10(9)/l.

We evaluated the effect of elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours on the incidence and severity of PVT in patients receiving intravenous fluids/drugs. \n We randomized 42 patients who were admitted for major abdominal surgery to either the control or study group (n = 21 in either group). Informed consent was obtained from all of them. Cannulae in the control group were removed only if the site became painful, the cannula got dislodged or there were signs and symptoms suggestive of PVT, namely pain, erythema, swelling, excessive warmth or a palpable venous cord. Cannulae in the study group were changed and re-sited electively every 48 hours. All the patients were examined every 24 hours for signs and symptoms of PVT at the current and previous sites of infusion. \n The incidence of PVT was 100% (21/21) in the control group and only 9.5% (2/21) in the study group (p<0.0001). The severity of PVT was also less in the study group compared with that in the control group.

This list was cross-referenced to all patients who underwent TIVAD removal from January 1, 2009, through January 30, 2010, to identify TIVADs that were removed within 30 days of placement. Retrospective chart review was performed to record patient demographics, including age, sex, cancer diagnosis, and indication for removal. Concurrent antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, and laboratory data before and within 30 days of placement were recorded. Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) were identified using U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. \n There were 1,183 ports placed and 13 removed.

Multiple emergency medicine and critical care studies have shown that lung-protective ventilation protocols reduce morbidity and mortality. Our primary objective was to determine if a group of EMS professionals could provide ventilations with a smaller BVM that would be sufficient to ventilate patients. Secondary objectives included 1) if the pediatric bag provided volumes similar to lung-protective ventilation in the hospital setting and 2) compare volumes provided to the patient depending on the type of airway (mask, King tube, and intubation). \n Using a patient simulator of a head and thorax that was able to record respiratory rate, tidal volume, peak pressure, and minute volume via a laptop computer, participants were asked to ventilate the simulator during six 1-minute ventilation tests. The first scenario was BVM ventilation with an oropharyngeal airway in place ventilating with both an adult- and pediatric-sized BVM, the second scenario had a supraglottic airway and both bags, and the third scenario had an endotracheal tube and both bags. Participants were enrolled in convenience manner while they were on-duty and the research staff was able to travel to their stations. Prior to enrolling, participants were not given any additional training on ventilation skills. \n We enrolled 50 providers from a large, busy, urban fire-based EMS agency with 14.96 (SD = 9.92) mean years of experience. Only 1.5% of all breaths delivered with the pediatric BVM during the ventilation scenarios were below the recommended tidal volume.

Time was the primary predictor variable. The nasal tip sensation, which was evaluated using objective and subjective assessments, was used as the primary outcome variable. The McNemar-Bowker test (time vs nasal tip sensation) was used to detect statistical significance. \n A total of 30 young women (age 20.04 \u00b1 3.63 years) were recruited for the present study. The preoperative mean touch threshold value was 3.60 units. One week after the injection, the women experienced a decrease in the touch threshold value by 2.50 units. However, the sensation recovered gradually during the follow-up period (1.51 units at week 2, 2.39 units at week 4, 3.01 units at week 8, and 3.35 units at week 12). Significant differences were detected between multiple different measurement points (P<.05).

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, potentially curative therapy (RP or EBRT) prolonged LE up to age 75 years but did not improve QALE at any age. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Prior decision-analytic models are based on outdated or suboptimal efficacy, patient preference, and comorbidity data. We estimated life expectancy (LE) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) associated with available treatments for localized prostate cancer in men aged>/= 65 years, adjusting for Gleason score, patient preferences, and comorbidity. \n We evaluated three treatments, using a decision-analytic Markov model: radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), and watchful waiting (WW). Rates of treatment complications and pretreatment incontinence and impotence were derived from published studies. We estimated treatment efficacy using three data sources: cancer registry cohort data, pooled case series, and modern radiotherapy studies. Utilities were obtained from 141 prostate cancer patients and from published studies. \n For men with well-differentiated tumors and few comorbidities, potentially curative therapy (RP or EBRT) prolonged LE up to age 75 years but did not improve QALE at any age. For moderately differentiated cancers, potentially curative therapy resulted in LE and QALE gains up to age 75 years. For poorly differentiated disease, potentially curative therapy resulted in LE and QALE gains up to age 80 years. Benefits of potentially curative therapy were restricted to men with no worse than mild comorbidity. When cohort and pooled case series data were used, RP was preferred over EBRT in all groups but was comparable to modern radiotherapy. \n Do older men benefit from curative therapy of localized prostate cancer?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe first thing is that the model is based on outdated or suboptimal efficacy, patient preference, and comorbidity data.\nThis is the first assumption.\nNow let's think about the options.\nOption a is \"yes\" and this is the correct answer.\nOption b is \"no\" and this is not the correct answer.\nOption c is \"maybe\" and this is not the correct answer.\nLet's think about the options again",

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: The high prevalence of obesity in African American (AA) women may result, in part, from a lower resting metabolic rate (RMR) than non-AA women. If true, AA women should require fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain weight. Our objective was to determine in the setting of a controlled feeding study, if AA women required fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain weight. \n This analysis includes 206 women (73% AA), aged 22-75 years, who participated in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial-a multicenter, randomized, controlled, feeding study comparing the effects of 3 dietary patterns on blood pressure in individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension. After a 3-week run-in, participants were randomized to 1 of 3 dietary patterns for 8 weeks. Calorie intake was adjusted during feeding to maintain stable weight. The primary outcome of this analysis was average daily calorie (kcal) intake during feeding. \n AA women had higher baseline weight and body mass index than non-AA women (78.4 vs 72.4 kg, P<.01; 29.0 vs 27.6 kg/m(2), P<.05, respectively).

The daily pain subset consisted of 709 hospice and 1,326 nonhospice residents. \n Detailed drug use data contained on the last MDS before death were used to examine analgesic management of daily pain. Guidelines from the American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) were used to identify analgesics not recommended for use in managing chronic pain in long-term care settings. The study outcome, regular treatment of daily pain, examined whether patients received any analgesic, other than those not recommended by AMDA, at least twice a day for each day of documented daily pain (i.e., 7 days before date of last MDS). \n Fifteen percent of hospice residents and 23% of nonhospice residents in daily pain received no analgesics (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-0.74). A lower proportion of hospice residents (21%) than of nonhospice residents (29%) received analgesics not recommended by AMDA (OR = 0.65, 95% CI =0.52-0.80).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to compare the hemodynamic performance of the Medtronic Mosaic and Edwards Perimount bioprostheses in the aortic position, and to evaluate prosthesis-specific differences in valve sizing and valve-size labeling. \n Between August 2000 and September 2002, 139 patients underwent isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) with the Mosaic (n = 67) or Perimount (n = 72) bioprosthesis. Intraoperatively, the internal aortic annulus diameter was measured by insertion of a gauge (Hegar dilator), while prosthesis size was determined by using the original sizers. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to determine hemodynamic and dimensional data. As the aim of AVR is to achieve a maximal effective orifice area (EOA) within a given aortic annulus, the ratio of EOA to patient aortic annulus area was calculated, the latter being based on annulus diameter measured intraoperatively. \n Operative mortality was 2.2% (Mosaic 3.0%; Perimount 1.4%; p = NS). Upsizing (using a prosthesis larger in labeled valve size than the patient's measured internal aortic annulus diameter) was possible in 28.4% of Mosaic patients and 8.3% of Perimount patients. The postoperative mean systolic pressure gradient ranged from 10.5 to 22.2 mmHg in the Mosaic group, and from 9.4 to 12.6 mmHg in the Perimount group; it was significantly lower for 21 and 23 Perimount valves than for 21 and 23 Mosaic valves.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Misty mesentery appearance is commonly reported in daily practice, usually as a secondary finding of various pathological entities, but sometimes it is encountered as an isolated finding that cannot be attributed to any other disease entity. We aimed to assess the prevalence of cases with incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on computed tomography (CT) and to summarize the pathologies leading to this appearance. \n Medical records and initial and follow-up CT features of patients with misty mesentery appearance between January 2011 and January 2013 were analysed. The study included cases with no known cause of misty mesentery according to associated CT findings, clinical history, or biochemical manifestations, and excluded patients with diseases known to cause misty mesentery, lymph nodes greater than a short-axis diameter of 5\u00a0mm, discrete mesenteric masses, or bowel wall thickening. \n There were a total of 561 patients in whom misty mesentery appearance was depicted on abdominopelvic CT scans. A total of 80 cases were found to have isolated incidental idiopathic misty mesentery, giving a prevalence of 7%. The common indication for CT examination was abdominal pain.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Concussions are commonly diagnosed in pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate compliance with ED discharge instructions for concussion management. \n A prospective cohort study was conducted from November 2011 to November 2012 in a pediatric ED at a regional Level 1 trauma center, serving 35,000 pediatric patients per year. Subjects were aged 8 years to 17 years and were discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of concussion. Exclusion criteria included recent (past 3 months) diagnosis of head injury, hospital admission, intracranial injury, skull fracture, suspected nonaccidental trauma, or preexisting neurologic condition. Subjects were administered a baseline survey in the ED and were given standardized discharge instructions for concussion by the treating physician. Telephone follow-up surveys were conducted at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after ED visit. \n A total of 150 patients were enrolled. The majority (67%) of concussions were sports related. Among sports-related concussions, soccer (30%), football (11%), lacrosse (8%), and basketball (8%) injuries were most common. More than one third (39%) reported return to play (RTP) on the day of the injury. Physician follow-up was equivalent for sport and nonsport concussions (2 weeks, 58%; 4 weeks, 64%). Sports-related concussion patients were more likely to follow up with a trainer (2 weeks, 25% vs. 10%, p = 0.06; 4 weeks, 29% vs. 8%, p<0.01). Of the patients who did RTP or normal activities at 2 weeks (44%), more than one third (35%) were symptomatic, and most (58%) did not receive medical clearance. Of the patients who had returned to activities at 4 weeks (64%), less than one quarter (23%) were symptomatic, and most (54%) received medical clearance. \n Are pediatric concussion patients compliant with discharge instructions?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n(1) What is the primary objective of the study?\n(2) What was the primary outcome of the study?\n(3) What is the primary finding of the study?\n(4) What is the conclusion of the study?\nThe primary objective of the study was to evaluate compliance with ED discharge instructions for concussion management.

Yes, weekend AMI patients are significantly less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac procedures, and experience significantly higher rates of adverse health outcomes. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: To examine the effect of a weekend hospitalization on the timing and incidence of intensive cardiac procedures, and on subsequent expenditures, mortality and readmission rates for Medicare patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). \n The primary data are longitudinal, administrative claims for 922,074 elderly, non-rural, fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with AMI from 1989 to 1998. Annual patient-level cohorts provide information on ex ante health status, procedure use, expenditures, and health outcomes. \n The patient is the primary unit of analysis. I use ordinary least squares regression to estimate the effect of weekend hospitalization on rates of cardiac catheterization, angioplasty, and bypass surgery (in various time periods subsequent to the initial hospitalization), 1-year expenditures and rates of adverse health outcomes in various periods following the AMI admission. \n Weekend AMI patients are significantly less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac procedures, and experience significantly higher rates of adverse health outcomes. Weekend admission leads to a 3.47 percentage point reduction in catheterization at 1 day, a 1.52 point reduction in angioplasty, and a 0.35 point reduction in by-pass surgery (p<.001 in all cases). The primary effect is delayed treatment, as weekend-weekday procedure differentials narrow over time from the initial hospitalization. Weekend patients experience a 0.38 percentage point (p<.001) increase in 1-year mortality and a 0.20 point (p<.001) increase in 1-year readmission with congestive heart failure. \n Do hospitals provide lower quality care on weekends?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nWe have a weekend effect.\nWeekend patients are less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac procedures.\nWeekend admission leads to a 3.47 percentage point reduction in catheterization at 1 day.\nWeekend patients experience a 0.38 percentage point (p<.001) increase in 1-year mortality and a 0.20 point (p<.001) increase in 1-",

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Updated guidelines for the screening and management of cervical cancer in the United States recommend starting Papanicolaou (Pap) testing at age 21 and screening less frequently with less aggressive management for abnormalities. We sought to examine updated Pap test screening guidelines and how they may affect the detection of invasive cervical cancer, especially among women<30 years of age. \n Patients diagnosed at Brigham and Women's Hospital with invasive cervical cancer between 2002 and 2012 were retrospectively identified. Prior screening history was obtained and patients were divided into two groups based on age<30 years or age \u226530 years. The two groups were then compared with respect to demographics, pathological findings, and time to diagnosis. \n A total of 288 patients with invasive cervical carcinoma were identified. Among these patients, 109 had adequate information on prior screening history. Invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) was diagnosed in 37 (33.94%) patients, whereas 64 (58.72%) patients were diagnosed with invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ISCC). The remaining eight patients were diagnosed with other types of cancers of the cervix. A total of 13 patients were younger than 30 while 96 patients were 30 or older. The mean time from normal Pap to diagnosis of IAC was 15 months in patients younger than 30 years of age compared to 56 months in patients aged 30 and older (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The mean time from normal Pap to diagnosis of ISCC was 38 months in patients younger than 30 years of age and 82 months in patients aged 30 and older (p\u2009=\u20090.018). \n Screening History Among Women with Invasive Cervical Cancer in an Academic Medical Center: Will We Miss Cancers Following Updated Guidelines?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n1.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Elevation of cardiac troponin (cTn) is considered specific for myocardial damage. Elevated cTn and echocardiogrpahic documentation of wall motion abnormalities (WMAs) that were recorded after extreme physical effort raise the question whether dobutamine stress echo (DSE), can also induce elevation of troponin. \n we prospective enrolled stable patients (age>18 years) referred to DSE. The exam was performed under standardized conditions. Blood samples for cTnI were obtained at baseline and 18-24 hours after the test. We aimed to compare between the clinical and echocardiographic features of patients with elevated cTnI and those without cTnI elevations. \n Fifty-seven consecutive patients were included. The average age was 64.4 \u00b1 10.7, 73% of the patients were males, and nearly half of the patients were known to have ischemic heart disease. Two of the patients were excluded due to technical difficulty. No signs of ischemia were recorded in 25 (45.4%). Among the patients with established ischemia on DSE, 12 (22%) had mild ischemia, 13 (23.6%) had moderate and 5 (9%) had severe ischemia. Angiography was performed in 13 (26%) of the patients, of which 7 had PCI and one was referred to bypass surgery.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with lower adolescent smoking susceptibility. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: To examine the relationship between exposure to pro-smoking messages in media and susceptibility to smoking adoption among middle school students. The hypothesis that parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with lower adolescent smoking susceptibility was tested. \n A sample of 1687 6th-, 7th-, and 8th-grade students from four Wisconsin middle schools were surveyed about their use of cigarettes, exposure to smoking in media, their views of smoking, and peer smoking behaviors. \n An index of smoking susceptibility was created using measures of cigarette use and future intention to smoke. A zero-order correlation for parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing and smoking susceptibility showed a strong association (r = -.36, p<.001). A hierarchical logistic regression yielded odds ratios (ORs) for being susceptible to or having tried smoking for three levels of parental R-rated movie restriction. Results show that compared to full restriction, respondents with partial or no restriction were more likely to be susceptible to smoking (partial restriction: OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.5-2.8; no restriction: OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 2.3-4.6), when controlling for demographic factors, and family and friend smoking.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone that exists in multiple forms. Immunoassays commonly used in clinical laboratories measure intact hCG, total beta hCG (intact hCG + hCG free beta-subunit), and/or hCG free beta-subunit. Measurement of serum concentrations of hCG is useful for confirmation and monitoring of pregnancy, diagnosis of trophoblastic diseases and monitoring of the efficacy of treatment, and prenatal screening. Correctly reporting results for the various forms of hCG is clinically important. \n We prepared samples by addition of intact hCG and hCG free beta-subunit to an essentially hCG-free human serum matrix. The samples were analyzed by participant laboratories using various immunoassay methods. \n We identified errors in participant reporting of intact hCG results as total beta hCG (9.3%; 22 of 235 laboratories) and total beta hCG as intact hCG (13.1%; 8 of 61 laboratories). \n Are laboratories reporting serum quantitative hCG results correctly?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nIn the first step, we have to identify the problem.\nIn the second step, we have to find the cause of the problem.\nIn the third step, we have to find the solution to the problem.\nIn the fourth step, we have to implement the solution.\nIn the fifth step, we have to evaluate the effectiveness of the solution.\nIn the sixth step, we have to maintain the solution.\nNow, we have to apply these six steps to the",

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: We compared left ventricular regional wall motion, the global left ventricular ejection fraction, and the New York Heart Association functional class pre- and postoperatively. \n Endomyocardial fibrosis is characterized by fibrous tissue deposition in the endomyocardium of the apex and/or inflow tract of one or both ventricles. Although left ventricular global systolic function is preserved, patients exhibit wall motion abnormalities in the apical and inferoapical regions. Fibrous tissue resection in New York Heart Association FC III and IV endomyocardial fibrosis patients has been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality. \n We prospectively studied 30 patients (20 female, 30+/-10 years) before and 5+/-8 months after surgery. The left ventricular ejection fraction was determined using the area-length method. Regional left ventricular motion was measured by the centerline method. Five left ventricular segments were analyzed pre- and postoperatively. Abnormality was expressed in units of standard deviation from the mean motion in a normal reference population. \n Left ventricular wall motion in the five regions did not differ between pre- and postoperative measurements.

No, the time from emergency room registration to appendectomy (ETA) would affect the incidence of perforation and postoperative complications in patients with acute appendicitis. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: This study investigated whether the time from emergency room registration to appendectomy (ETA) would affect the incidence of perforation and postoperative complications in patients with acute appendicitis. \n Patients who underwent an appendectomy at the Ren-Ai branch of Taipei City Hospital between January 2010 and October 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Their demographics, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, body temperature, computed tomography scan usage, operation method, pathology report, postoperative complication, length of hospital stay, and ETA were abstracted. Multivariate analysis was performed to search the predictors, including ETA, of outcomes for the perforation and postoperative complication rates. \n A total of 236 patients were included in the study. Perforation occurred in 12.7% (30/236) and postoperative complications developed in 24.1% (57/236) of these patients. There were 121 patients with ETA<8 hours, 88 patients with ETA of 8-24 hours, and 27 patients with ETA>24 hours; patients with ETA>24 hours had significantly longer hospital stay. Univariate analysis showed that perforated patients were significantly older, and had higher C-reactive protein level, longer hospital stay, and higher complication rate. Patients who developed postoperative complications were significantly older, and had higher neutrophil count, less use of computed tomography, and higher open appendectomy rate. After multivariate analysis, age \u226555 years was the only predictor for perforation [odds ratio (OR) = 3.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.54-8.68]; for postoperative complications, age \u226555 years (OR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.84-3.25), perforated appendicitis (OR = 3.17; 95% CI, 1.28-7.85), and open appendectomy (OR = 3.21; 95% CI, 1.36-7.58) were associated.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Hypertension is one of the important contributing factors linked with both causation and development of kidney disease. It is a multifactorial, polygenic, and complex disorder due to interaction of several risk genes with environmental factors. The present study was aimed to explore genetic polymorphism in ACE-1 gene as a risk factor for CKD among hypertensive patients. \n Three hundred patients were enrolled in the study. Ninety were hypertensive patients with CKD taken as cases, whereas 210 hypertensive patients without CKD were taken as controls. Demographic data including age, sex, Body mass index (BMI), and other risk factors were also recorded. DNA was extracted from blood by salting out method. Genotyping of ACE gene was done by PCR technique. All the statistical analysis was done by using Epi Info and SPSS version 16 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). \n Mean age was higher in the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Variables among two groups were compared out of which age, BMI, hemoglobin (Hb) was found to be statistically significant whereas other variables like systolic blood pressure, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein were not.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Both medical therapy and laparoscopic antireflux surgery have been shown to improve quality of life in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Although patients with poor symptom control or side effects on medical therapy might be expected to have improved quality of life after surgery, our aim was to determine, for the first time, whether patients whose symptoms are well controlled on medical therapy but who decide to undergo surgery (patient preference) would experience improved quality of life. \n Retrospective analysis of our patient database (1998-2003, n=313) identified 60 patients who underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery for the indication of patient preference. Two generic quality-of-life questionnaires (Short Form 36 and Psychological General Well-Being index) and a gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale) were completed preoperatively, while on medical therapy, and 6 months after surgery. \n Thirty-eight patients completed all three questionnaires at both time intervals: 31 males, seven females; mean age 42 (15-66) years. Preoperative scores while on medical therapy were significantly improved after surgery: Short Form 36 median physical composite scores 52.0 and 54.0 (P=0.034) and mental composite scores 51.0 and 56.0 (P=0.020); Psychological General Well-Being median total scores 78.0 and 90.0 (P=0.0001); Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale median total scores 2.13 and 1.73 (P=0.0007) and reflux scores 2.50 and 1.00 (P<0.0001). \n Does laparoscopic antireflux surgery improve quality of life in patients whose gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is well controlled with medical therapy?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nFirst, we know that medical therapy is effective in controlling the symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.\nSecond, we know that laparoscopic antireflux surgery is effective in controlling the symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.\nThird, we know that medical therapy is effective in improving the quality of life of patients with gastro-oesophageal",

After stable responding on a free choice between alcohol/saccharin and water, rats were exposed to 5, 10 or 15 min of alcohol-associated cues or 5 min of non-alcohol associated cues. The effect of a 5-min cue was measured after a 10-day break from training or pre-treatment with 0.03, 0.1 or 1 mg/kg naltrexone. Rats given 5 min of alcohol-associated cues responded significantly more on the active lever (26% increase) and consumed more alcohol as verified by increased blood alcohol levels (8.9 mM versus control 7.5 mM). Ten or 15 min of cues did not change alcohol consumption and 5 min in a novel environment decreased response by 66%.

Gender difference in survival of resected non-small cell lung cancer: histology-related phenomenon Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: It remains controversial whether there is a gender difference in survival of patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer. \n We retrospectively analyzed 2770 patients (1689 men and 1081 women) with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent pulmonary resection between 1995 and 2005 at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo. A gender difference in survival was studied in all patients, in those divided according to histology or pathologic stage, and in propensity-matched gender pairs. \n There were no differences in background, such as preoperative pulmonary function, operation procedures, or operative mortality. The proportions of adenocarcinoma and pathologic stage I in women were greater than those in men (93.6% vs 61.7% and 71.4% vs 58.6%, respectively) (P<.001). Overall 5-year survival of women was better than that of men (81% vs 70%, P<.001). In adenocarcinoma, the overall 5-year survival for women was better than that for men in pathologic stage I (95% vs 87%, P<.001) and in pathologic stage II or higher (58% vs 51%, P = .017). In non-adenocarcinoma, there was no significant gender difference in survival in pathologic stage I (P = .313) or pathologic stage II or higher (P = .770). The variables such as age, smoking status, histology, and pathologic stage were used for propensity score matching, and survival analysis of propensity score-matched gender pairs did not show a significant difference (P = .69). \n Gender difference in survival of resected non-small cell lung cancer: histology-related phenomenon?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The choice of the therapeutic strategy was based on the clinical condition of the patients, taking into account the possibility to maintain the prone position continuously and the risk of morbidity due to prolonged bed rest. Six patients were treated conservatively (position prone for three weeks), ten patients were treated by positioning an external CSF lumbar drainage for ten days.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Surgical excision of ovarian endometriomas in patients desiring pregnancy has recently been criticized because of the risk of damage to healthy ovarian tissue and consequent reduction of ovarian reserve. A correct diagnosis in cases not scheduled for surgery is therefore mandatory in order to avoid unexpected ovarian cancer misdiagnosis. Endometriosis is often associated with high levels of CA125. This marker is therefore not useful for discriminating ovarian endometrioma from ovarian malignancy. The aim of this study was to establish if the serum marker CA72-4 could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between ovarian endometriosis and epithelial ovarian cancer. \n Serums CA125 and CA72-4 were measured in 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer. \n High CA125 concentrations were observed in patients with ovarian endometriosis and in those with ovarian cancer. A marked difference in CA72-4 values was observed between women with ovarian cancer (71.0%) and patients with endometriosis (13.8%) (P<0.0001). \n Is CA72-4 a useful biomarker in differential diagnosis between ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe question is: Is CA72-4 a useful biomarker in differential diagnosis between ovarian endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer?\nThe first sentence says that the serum marker CA125 was measured in 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas and 55 patients with ovarian cancer.\nThis sentence is important because it tells us that CA125 was measured in both groups.\n",

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Reconstruction of the joint line is crucial in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A routine height of tibial cut to maintain the natural joint line may compromise the preservation of the PCL. Since the PCL footprint is not accessible prior to tibial osteotomy, it seems beneficial to identify a reliable extraarticular anatomic landmark for predicting the PCL footprint and being visible within standard TKA approach. The fibula head predicts reliably the location of PCL footprint; however, it is not accessible during TKA. The aim of this study now was to analyze whether the tibial tuberosity can serve as a reliable referencing landmark to estimate the PCL footprint height prior to tibial cut. \n The first consecutive case series included 216 CR TKA. Standing postoperative lateral view radiographs were utilized to measure the vertical distance between tibial tuberosity and tibial osteotomy plane. In the second case series, 223 knee MRIs were consecutively analyzed to measure the vertical distance between tibial tuberosity and PCL footprint. The probability of partial or total PCL removal was calculated for different vertical distances between tibial tuberosity and tibial cutting surface. \n The vertical distance between the tibial tuberosity and tibial cut averaged 24.7 \u00b1 4 mm. The average vertical distance from tibial tuberosity to proximal and to distal PCL footprint was found to be 22 \u00b1 4.4 and 16 \u00b1 4.4 mm, respectively.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: It has recently been shown that non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) may be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Based on known ethic differences in lipid parameters and cardiovascular risk prediction, we sought to study the predictability of attaining non-HDL-C target and long-term major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) in Thai patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) compared to attaining LDL-C target. \n We retrospectively obtained the data of all patients who were admitted at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital due to AMI during 2006-2013. The mean non-HDL-C and LDL-C during long-term follow-up were used to predict MACE at each time point. The patients were classified as target attainment if non-HDL-C\u2009<100\u00a0mg/dl and/or LDL-C\u2009<70\u00a0mg/dl. The MACE was defined as combination of all-cause death, nonfatal coronary event and nonfatal stroke. \n During mean follow-up of 2.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\u00a0years among 868 patients after AMI, 34.4% achieved non-HDL-C target, 23.7% achieved LDL-C target and 21.2% experienced MACEs.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: The hypothesis of this prospective study is that intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is an effective predictor of fetal acidosis during labor. Various clinical conditions, such as term versus preterm gestation, first stage versus second stage of labor, and fetal heart rate (FHR) variable decelerations versus late decelerations will be tested. \n During the study period, 113 patients were studied prospectively in either active phase of first stage (n = 53) or during the second stage of labor (n = 60). They were selected from cases exhibiting moderate to severe FHR variable decelerations or late decelerations. The fetuses of study subjects received a VAS for three seconds and FHR changes were recorded. Fetal scalp blood pH or umbilical arterial blood pH was obtained within 15 minutes of VAS. The relationship between FHR responses to VAS and fetal blood pH in term and preterm gestations, the relationship of two tests (VAS and fetal blood pH) to type of FHR decelerations, and the predictability of neonatal morbidity by two tests were analyzed. Where appropriate, Fisher's exact test (p<0.05 was considered statistically different) and the odd ratio with 95% confidence intervals were used for statistical analyses. \n Excellent association between acceleration response to VAS and pH>or = 7.20, and between a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) and pH<7.20 were found in the first stage of labor, the second stage of labor, and the combination of both stages together (p = 0.0001, OR = 10.6 [3.3-34.0]). It was observed that negative VAS responses for predicting fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) were comparable between term (>or = 37 weeks) and preterm (<37 weeks,>or = 34 weeks) fetuses. Since the preterm fetuses enrolled in the study were limited in number, it is difficult to draw adequate conclusions. The positive predictive value (PPV) of fetal acidosis was 67% in both groups of FHR variable decelerations and late decelerations, but the false negative rate of acceleration VAS response for predicting no acidosis was significantly higher in the group of late decelerations (29% vs 8%, p = 0.034). Finally, both a negative VAS response and fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) have equal predictability for neonatal morbidity. The PPV of NICU admission by a negative VAS response was two times higher than that of fetal acidosis (PPV = 61% vs 29%, p = 0.038). \n Is intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation an effective predictor of fetal acidosis?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n1.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Ischemic preconditioning (IP) is initiated through one or several short bouts of ischemia and reperfusion which precede a prolonged ischemia. To test whether a reperfusion must precede the prolonged index ischemia, a series without reperfusion (intraischemic preconditioning: IIP) and a series with gradual onset of ischemia, i.e. ramp ischemia (RI), which is possibly related to the development of hibernation, was compared to conventional IP (CIP). \n Experiments were performed an 27 blood-perfused rabbit hearts (Langendorff apparatus) that were randomized into one of four series: (1) control (n = 7): 60 min normal flow - 60 min low flow (10%) ischemia - 60 min reperfusion. (2) CIP (n = 7): 4 times 5 min zero flow with 10 min reperfusion each - 60 min low flow (10%) - ischemia 60 min reperfusion. (3) IIP (n = 7): 50 min normal flow - 10 min no flow - 60min low flow (10%) ischemia -4 60min reperfusion. (4) RI (n=6): gradual reduction to 10% flow during 60min - 60min low flow (10%) ischemia - 60min reperfusion. At the end of each protocol, the infarcted area was assessed. \n The infarct area in control hearts was 6.7+/-1.4% (means+/-SEM) of LV total area, in CIP hearts 2.6+/-0.8%, in IIP hearts 3.1+/-0.5%, and in RI hearts 3.0+/-0.3% (all p<0.05 vs. control).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Sternal instability with mediastinitis is a very serious complication after median sternotomy. Biomechanical studies have suggested superiority of rigid plate fixation over wire cerclage for sternal fixation. This study tests the hypothesis that sternal closure stability can be improved by adding plate fixation in a human cadaver model. \n Midline sternotomy was performed in 18 human cadavers. Four sternal closure techniques were tested: (1) approximation with six interrupted steel wires; (2) approximation with six interrupted cables; (3) closure 1 (wires) or 2 (cables) reinforced with a transverse sternal plate at the sixth rib; (4) Closure using 4 sternal plates alone. Intrathoracic pressure was increased in all techniques while sternal separation was measured by three pairs of sonomicrometry crystals fixed at the upper, middle and lower parts of the sternum until 2.0 mm separation was detected. Differences in displacement pressures were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and Regression Coefficients. \n Intrathoracic pressure required to cause 2.0 mm separation increased significantly from 183.3 +/- 123.9 to 301.4 +/- 204.5 in wires/cables alone vs. wires/cables plus one plate respectively, and to 355.0 +/- 210.4 in the 4 plates group (p<0.05).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Dryness of the mouth is one of the most distressing chronic toxicities of radiation therapy in head and neck cancers. In this study, parotid function was assessed in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy. Parotid function was assessed with the help of a questionnaire and parotid scintigraphy, especially with regards to unilateral sparing of the parotid gland. \n In total, 19 patients were treated with compensator-based IMRT between February 2003 and March 2004. The dose to the clinical target volume ranged between 66 and 70 Gy in 30-35 fractions to 95% of the isodose volume. Ipsilateral high-risk neck nodes received an average dose of 60 Gy and the contralateral low-risk neck received a dose of 54-56 Gy. Eight of 19 patients also received concomitant chemotherapy. \n Subjective toxicity to the parotid glands was assessed with the help of a questionnaire at 0, 3 and 6 months and objective toxicity was assessed with parotid scintigraphy at 0 and 3 months. The mean dose to the ipsilateral parotid gland ranged from 19.5 to 52.8 Gy (mean 33.14 Gy) and the mean dose to the contralateral gland was 11.1-46.6 Gy (mean 26.85 Gy). At a median follow-up of 13 months, 9/19 patients had no symptoms of dryness of the mouth (grade I), 8/19 had mild dryness of the mouth (grade II) and only 2/19 had grade III xerostomia, although the parotid gland could only be spared on one side in most of the patients. \n Can dose reduction to one parotid gland prevent xerostomia?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n1.

Yes, enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Neutrophil infiltration of the lung is characteristic of early posttraumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study examines the ability of neutrophils isolated (over the first 24 hrs) from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma to migrate in response to interleukin-8. Interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung within 2 hrs of major trauma in patients who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. We hypothesized that enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS. \n Prospective observational study. \n University Hospital Wales, the Royal Gwent Hospital, and East Glamorgan General Hospital. Laboratory work was conducted at the Institute of Nephrology. \n Adult blunt trauma victims with Injury Severity Score>or = 18. \n Neutrophils were isolated from citrated blood from 17 adult blunt major trauma patients at admission (0 hrs) and 8 and 24 hrs later. Identical samples were obtained from normal laboratory volunteers (n = 9). The neutrophil count in each specimen was measured, and the number of neutrophils migrating across porous tissue culture inserts in response to defined concentrations of interleukin-8 (0, 10, 30, and 100 ng/mL) was quantitated by peroxidase assay. Neutrophil counts in the whole blood specimens obtained from those later developing ARDS were elevated significantly at admission and declined rapidly throughout the next 24 hrs. Significantly greater numbers of trauma patients' neutrophils migrated to concentrations of interleukin-8 (30 and 100 ng/mL) at each time point when compared with normal volunteers (Mann-Whitney U test, p<.05). Neutrophils isolated from major trauma patients exhibited an enhanced migratory response to high concentrations of interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hrs of admission, in contrast to the normal physiologic attenuation of migration seen in neutrophils isolated from normal laboratory volunteers. \n Increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma: a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n1.

Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between obesity and increasing BMI level and asthma control. \n Of 292 subjects with a mean age of 47 years, the majority were women (82%) and African American (67%). There was a high prevalence of obesity with 63%, with only 15% normal weight. The mean score from all 4 questionnaires showed an average suboptimal asthma control (mean score/maximum possible score): ACCI (8.3/19), ACT (15.4/25), ACQ (2.1/6), and ATAQ (1.3/4).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: The purpose of this study was to evaluate safe depth for suture anchor insertion during acetabular labral repair and to determine the neighbouring structures at risk during drilling and anchor insertion. \n Ten human cadaveric hips (six males and four females) were obtained. Acetabular labral surface was prepared and marked for right hips as 12, 1 and 3 o'clock positions, for left hips 12, 11 and 9 o'clock positions. Those were defined as anterior, anterior-superior and superior zones, respectively. These labral positions were drilled at defined zones. After measurements, depth of the bone at 10\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 drill angles on zones was compared statistically. \n Acetabular bone widths at investigated labral insertion points did not statistically differ. A total of 14 injuries in 60 penetrations occurred (23.3\u00a0%) with free drill penetrations, and no injuries occurred with stopped drill penetrations.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation of c-kit and the impact of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was examined in the three uveal melanoma cell lines OCM-1, OCM-3, and 92-1. \n Eighty-four of 134 paraffin-embedded samples and six of eight fresh-frozen samples expressed c-kit. c-Kit was strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal melanoma cells compared with cutaneous melanoma cells. Moreover, in contrast to cutaneous melanoma cell lines c-kit maintained a high phosphorylation level in serum-depleted uveal melanoma cells. No activation-related mutations in exon 11 of the KIT gene were found. On the contrary, expression of the stem cell growth factor (c-kit ligand) was detected in all three uveal melanoma cell lines, suggesting the presence of autocrine (paracrine) stimulation pathways. Treatment of uveal melanoma cell lines with STI571, which blocks c-kit autophosphorylation, resulted in cell death.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: It is widely accepted that exemplary surgical care involves a surgeon's involvement in the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative periods. In an era of ever-expanding therapeutic modalities available to the vascular surgeon, it is important that trainees gain experience in preoperative decision-making and how this affects a patient's operative and postoperative course. The purpose of this study was to define the current experience of residents on a vascular surgery service regarding the continuity of care they are able to provide for patients and the factors affecting this experience. \n This prospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and conducted at the University of British Columbia during January 2005. All patients who underwent a vascular procedure at either of the two teaching hospitals were included. In addition to type of case (emergent, outpatient, inpatient), resident demographic data and involvement in each patient's care (preoperative assessment, postoperative daily assessment, and follow-up clinic assessment) were recorded. Categoric data were analyzed with the chi2 test. \n The study included 159 cases, of which 65% were elective same-day admission patients, 20% were elective previously admitted patients; and 15% were emergent.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Women's experiences of childbirth may affect their future reproduction, and the model of care affects their experiences, suggesting that a causal link may exist between model of care and future reproduction. The study objective was to examine whether the birth center model of care during a woman's first pregnancy affects whether or not she has a second baby, and on the spacing to the next birth. \n Between October 1989 and July 1993, a total of 1860 women at low medical risk in early pregnancy, who participated in a randomized controlled trial of in-hospital birth center care versus standard care, gave birth. The 1063 primiparas in the trial, 543 in the birth center group and 520 in the standard care group, were included in a secondary analysis in which women's personal identification codes were linked to the Swedish National Birth Register, which included information about their subsequent birth during the following 7 to 10 years.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: To explore whether early treatment would shorten the duration of headache from headache onset to its peak and reduce headache severity at peak. \n Prior clinical studies almost exclusively focused on headache relief after dosing. No data are available on whether early intervention affects the duration from headache onset to peak and headache severity at peak. \n Adult migraineurs were enrolled in this observational study from multi-site headache clinics. Patients recorded their migraine experiences via an electronic diary over 1 month. Patients reported the time and pain severity at onset, dosing, and peak. We used a linear mixed model to evaluate the impact of the timing of treatment and to adjust for covariates and correlation of observations within subjects. \n A total of 182 patients reported 970 migraine episodes, 620 of which were treated before headaches progressed to peak. Mean time from headache onset to peak varied from 1.9 hours to 8.9 hours for patients treated within 15 minutes of onset and those who waited for 4 or more hours, respectively. However, early intervention was not associated with reduced headache severity at peak. In multivariate analysis, early treatment, use of triptans, and mild migraine headache in the past 3 months were significantly associated with shorter time from onset to headache peak.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Acute hepatitis C virus infection in the era of universal screening of blood products has not disappeared, and is thought to be transmitted primarily via injecting drug use. A growing body of evidence supports iatrogenic transmission as an important mode of transmission. The aim of this study was to examine transmission routes and clinical characteristics in a group of patients with acute hepatitis C in Israel. \n A retrospective chart review was conducted in three different liver clinics in Israel, of all new hepatitis C patients. Patients identified as possible acute hepatitis C were re-interviewed and all other sources such as blood bank records and pre-employment check-ups reviewed in order to establish the diagnosis of acute hepatitis C infection and to identify the transmission route. \n Twenty-nine patients were found to have acute hepatitis C, representing 0.75% of all new referrals for hepatitis C. The most frequent (65%) mode of transmission was iatrogenic involving several, often minimal, procedures and clinical settings. The group in which iatrogenic transmission was suspected was older and the patients more often in monogamous relationship compared with other transmission routes groups.

Both diseases are associated with neutrophilic inflammation and frequent isolation of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, including nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), from the lower airway. Defective alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic bronchial epithelial cells (efferocytosis), as found in other chronic lung diseases, may also contribute to tissue damage and neutrophil persistence. Thus, in children with bronchiectasis or PBB and in control subjects, we quantified the phagocytosis of airway apoptotic cells and NTHi by alveolar macrophages and related the phagocytic capacity to clinical and airway inflammation. \n Children with bronchiectasis (n = 55) or PBB (n = 13) and control subjects (n = 13) were recruited.

The study aim was to explore suitability of the 2001 feeding recommendations for infants of HIV-infected mothers for a rural region in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa specifically with respect to adequacy of micronutrients and essential fatty acids, cost, and preparation times of replacement milks. \n Nutritional adequacy, cost, and preparation time of home-prepared replacement milks containing powdered full cream milk (PM) and fresh full cream milk (FM) and different micronutrient supplements (2 g UNICEF micronutrient sachet, government supplement routinely available in district public health clinics, and best available liquid paediatric supplement found in local pharmacies) were compared. Costs of locally available ingredients for replacement milk were used to calculate monthly costs for infants aged one, three, and six months. Total monthly costs of ingredients of commercial and home-prepared replacement milks were compared with each other and the average monthly income of domestic or shop workers. Time needed to prepare one feed of replacement milk was simulated. \n When mixed with water, sugar, and each micronutrient supplement, PM and FM provided<50% of estimated required amounts for vitamins E and C, folic acid, iodine, and selenium and<75% for zinc and pantothenic acid. PM and FM made with UNICEF micronutrient sachets provided 30% adequate intake for niacin. FM prepared with any micronutrient supplement provided no more than 32% vitamin D. All PMs provided more than adequate amounts of vitamin D. Compared with the commercial formula, PM and FM provided 8-60% of vitamins A, E, and C, folic acid, manganese, zinc, and iodine. Preparations of PM and FM provided 11% minimum recommended linoleic acid and 67% minimum recommended alpha-linolenic acid per 450 ml mixture. It took 21-25 minutes to optimally prepare 120 ml of replacement feed from PM or commercial infant formula and 30-35 minutes for the fresh milk preparation.

We sought to examine whether any gender differences in symptom profile might account for this difference in rates. \n This study was a population-based 13-year follow-up survey of community-dwelling adults living in East Baltimore in 1981. Subjects were the continuing participants of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program. Participants interviewed between 1993 and 1996 with complete data on depressive symptoms and covariates were included (n = 1727). We applied structural equations with a measurement model for dichotomous data (the MIMIC-multiple indicators, multiple causes-model) to compare symptoms between women and men, in relation to the nine symptom groups comprising the diagnostic criteria for major depression, adjusting for several potentially influential characteristics (namely, age, self-reported ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, and employment). \n There were no significant gender differences in the self-report of depression symptoms even taking into account the higher level of depressive symptoms of women and the influence of other covariates.

The aim of this prospective study was to assess the prevalence and risk of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and selected bacteria isolated from the lower genital tract and to determine the socioeconomic and microbiological characteristics that might be responsible for poor pregnancy outcome observed among unmarried pregnant women. \n The study population comprised 196 pregnant women attending 10 randomly selected outpatient maternity units in the Lodz region, central Poland. Cervicovaginal samples were obtained between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation. Based on Spiegel's criteria, gram-stained vaginal smears were examined for BV and the BV-associated flora was sought by culture. To evaluate the risk factors, relative risk ratios were calculated using EPI INFO software. \n Among 196 pregnant women, 40 (20.4%) were unmarried. BV was diagnosed among 55 (28.1%) women studied. In the univariate analysis, unmarried pregnant women were characterized by younger age, primary educational level, poor economic situation and excessive smoking during pregnancy, as compared to married women. The unmarried status was a borderline risk factor for BV (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 0.94-4.9) after adjustment for age, smoking and education. An analysis of the microbiological culture from the lower genital tract revealed that unmarried pregnant women had a higher risk for several types of pathological microflora, as compared to married women.

We decided to study the temperature levels during preservation with the Biotainer storage can and Vitalpack transport pack. Temperature was monitored using the Thermobouton probe during preservation of pig kidneys, in the same conditions used with human grafts. The probe recorded the temperature level every 10 minutes during four days. We compared the results found with the new storage can with results obtained in the same conditions with the storage can formerly used by our team.

If a significant reaction that requires ICU management does not occur, these patients are then transferred to a regular ward where future blood products are administered. The aim of this project was to determine if heightened observation such as temporary ICU admissions for the first transfusion are warranted. \n From the blood bank records of a tertiary care pediatric hospital, a list of patients on whom a transfusion reaction was reported between 2007 and 2012, the type of reaction and the patient's transfusion history, were extracted. The hospital location where the transfusion occurred, and whether the patient was evaluated by the ICU team or transferred to the ICU for management of the reaction was determined from the patient's electronic medical record. \n There were 174 acute reactions in 150 patients.

The primary aim of this study was to assess whether an elderly clinical population correctly endorsed the response to call for emergency services when presented with signs and symptoms of stroke using a standardized questionnaire. \n We performed a cross-sectional study among elderly out-patients (\u226560 years) in Buenos Aires, Argentina randomly recruited from a government funded health clinic. The correct endorsement of intention to call 911 was assessed with the Stroke Action Test and the cut-off point was set at \u226575%. Knowledge of stroke and clinical and socio-demographic indicators were also collected and evaluated as predictors of correct endorsement using logistic regression. \n Among 367 elderly adults, 14% correctly endorsed intention to call 911. Presented with the most typical signs and symptoms, only 65% reported that they would call an ambulance. Amaurosis Fugax was the symptom for which was called the least (15%).

    "Let's think step by step. Virtual planning and guided surgery resulted in time savings during surgery and this time gain resulted in self-funding of such planning through the time saved. Virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction is economically viable. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Virtual planning and guided surgery with or without prebent or milled plates are becoming more and more common for mandibular reconstruction with fibular free flaps (FFFs). Although this excellent surgical option is being used more widely, the question of the additional cost of planning and cutting-guide production has to be discussed. In capped payment systems such additional costs have to be offset by other savings if there are no special provisions for extra funding. Our study was designed to determine whether using virtual planning and guided surgery resulted in time saved during surgery and whether this time gain resulted in self-funding of such planning through the time saved. \n All consecutive cases of FFF surgery were evaluated during a 2-year period. Institutional data were used to determine the price of 1 minute of operative time. The time for fibula molding, plate adaptation, and insetting was recorded. \n During the defined period, we performed 20 mandibular reconstructions using FFFs, 9 with virtual planning and guided surgery and 11 freehand cases. One minute of operative time was calculated to cost US $47.50. Multiplying this number by the time saved, we found that the additional cost of virtual planning was reduced from US $5,098 to US $1,231.50 with a prebent plate and from US $6,980 to US $3,113.50 for a milled plate. \n Are virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction economically viable?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nVirtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction are becoming more common.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, the level of Hcy in the blood of patients with vitiligo was significantly higher in patients with vitiligo than in controls. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Pigmentary dilution is observed in patients with homocystinuria. Therefore, it is possible that an increase of local homocysteine (Hcy) interferes with normal melanogenesis and plays a role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. Vitamin B12 and folic acid, levels of which are decreased in vitiligo, are important cofactors in the metabolism of Hcy. Consequently, a nutritional deficiency in either of these two vitamins will result in an increase in homocysteine in the circulation, a finding that we expect to find in vitiligo. \n To determine the level of Hcy in the blood of patients with vitiligo as a first step in revealing if it has any relationship with the pathogenesis of vitiligo and consequently if this will have an impact on the treatment of vitiligo. \n Twenty-six patients of both sexes with vitiligo (age range 20-50 years, mean 31.4 +/- 8.09) and 26 age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. After excluding factors that may affect serum Hcy levels, blood samples from patients and controls were obtained for homocysteine determination by enzyme immunoassay. \n The mean serum level of Hcy was significantly higher in patients with vitiligo than in controls (21.61 +/- 13.28 vs. 13.1 +/- 4.88 micromol L(-1); P<0.001). The Hcy level was significantly higher in male patients than in female patients (28.67 +/- 15.95 vs. 15.56 +/- 6.2 micromol L(-1); P<0.001) and in male controls compared with female controls (15.07 +/- 4.61 vs. 12.05 +/- 4.82 micromol L(-1); P<0.001). The homocysteine level was related to the activity of vitiligo and was significantly higher in patients with progressive disease than in controls (25.4 +/- 14.99 vs. 13.1 +/- 4.88 micromol L(-1); P<0.001). No significant difference in Hcy levels was found between either untreated vitiligo patients (22.77 +/- 13.36 micromol L(-1)) or patients receiving ultraviolet therapy (20.45 +/- 13.73 micromol L(-1)) and the total patient group (21.62 +/- 13.28 micromol L(-1)). \n Is there a relationship between homocysteine and vitiligo?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nIn the patient group, we find a significant increase in homocysteine levels, which is higher in male patients than in female patients.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is the most frequent postoperative complication after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD). This prospective, non-randomized study was undertaken to determine whether the incidence of DGE may be reduced by modifying the original reconstructive anatomy with a retrocolic duodenojejunostomy towards an antecolic duodenojejunostomy. \n The study was comprised of 51 patients who underwent PPPD between August 1994 and November 1997. The operation was carried out as originally described but was modified by performing the duodenojejunostomy antecolically. Clinical data were recorded prospectively, with special regard to DGE. \n After PPPD, the nasogastric tube could be removed at a median of 2 days (range 1-22 days) postoperatively; in two patients, the nasogastric tube was reinserted because of vomiting and nausea. A liquid diet was started at a median of 5 days (3-11 days); the patients were able to tolerate a full, regular diet at a median of 10 days (7-28 days). The overall incidence of DGE was 12% (n=6). No postoperative complications other than DGE were exhibited by 36 patients (71%). In this group, DGE was only seen in one patient (3%).

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, the results of the IHC and the meta-analysis suggest that Ki-67 is a prognostic marker of UTUC. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC) is a relatively uncommon but aggressive disease. The Ki-67 antigen is a classic marker of cellular proliferation, but there is still controversy regarding the significance and importance of Ki-67 in tumor progression. \n In this study, we first detected Ki-67 expression in UTUC patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Subsequently, we quantitatively combined the results with those from the published literature in a meta-analysis after searching several databases. \n IHC results demonstrated that patients with muscle-invasive tumors (T2-T4) had higher Ki-67 expression than those with non-muscle-invasive tumors (Tis-T1), suggesting that high Ki-67 expression may be associated with the aggressive form of UTUC. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients with high Ki-67 expression had significantly poorer cancer-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Furthermore, multivariate analysis suggested that Ki-67 expression was an independent prognostic factor for CSS (hazard ratio, HR=3.196) and DFS (HR=3.517) in UTUC patients. Then, a meta-analysis of the published literature investigating Ki-67 expression and its effects on UTUC prognosis was conducted. After searching the PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Scopus databases, 12 articles met the eligibility criteria for this analysis. The eligible studies included a total of 1740 patients with a mean number of 82 patients per study (range, 38-475). The combined results showed that increased Ki-67 levels were associated with poor survival and disease progression, with a pooled HR estimate of 2.081 and 2.791, respectively. In subgroup analysis, the pooled HR was statistically significant for cancer-specific survival (HR=2.276), metastasis-free survival (HR=3.008) and disease-free survival (HR=6.336). \n Is Overexpression of Ki-67 a Prognostic Biomarker of Upper Tract Urinary Carcinoma?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n(a) yes:\nWe can see that the patients with muscle-invasive tumors (T2-T4) had higher Ki-67 expression than those with non-muscle-invasive tumors (Tis-T1), suggesting that high Ki-67 expression may be associated with the aggressive form of UTUC.\n(b) no:\nKaplan-Meier curves showed that patients with high Ki-6",

The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a six-month treatment of amblyopia on choroidal thickness in anisometropic hyperopic amblyopic children. \n Thirty-two anisometropic hyperopic children with unilateral amblyopia were included in this prospective study. Subfoveal choroidal thickness was measured as the distance between the retinal pigment epithelium and the chorioscleral edge, by using spectral domain enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography. The treatment of amblyopia was performed based on the full correction of the refractive error with eyeglasses, a refractive adaptation phase and occlusion by patching the fellow eye. \n The mean visual acuity of the amblyopic eyes significantly increased from 0.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3 to 0.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 logMAR after the treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.001).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: The protraction of external beam radiotherapy (RT) time is detrimental in several disease sites. In prostate cancer, the overall treatment time can be considerable, as can the potential for treatment breaks. We evaluated the effect of elapsed treatment time on outcome after RT for prostate cancer. \n Between April 1989 and November 2004, 1,796 men with prostate cancer were treated with RT alone. The nontreatment day ratio (NTDR) was defined as the number of nontreatment days divided by the total elapsed days of RT. This ratio was used to account for the relationship between treatment duration and total RT dose. Men were stratified into low risk (n = 789), intermediate risk (n = 798), and high risk (n = 209) using a single-factor model. \n The 10-year freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) rate was 68% for a NTDR<33% vs. 58% for NTDR>/=33% (p = 0.02; BF was defined as a prostate-specific antigen nadir + 2 ng/mL).

    "Let's think step by step. No, fondaparinux is not recommended for perioperative bridging. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: A possible role for fondaparinux as a bridging agent in the perioperative setting is explored. \n Anticoagulation guidelines provide minimal direction on the perioperative use of fondaparinux. Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: To be able to adhere to discharge instructions after a visit to the emergency department (ED), patients should understand both the care that they received and their discharge instructions. The objective of this study is to assess, at discharge, patients' comprehension of their ED care and instructions and their awareness of deficiencies in their comprehension. \n We conducted structured interviews of 140 adult English-speaking patients or their primary caregivers after ED discharge in 2 health systems. Participants rated their subjective understanding of 4 domains: (1) diagnosis and cause; (2) ED care; (3) post-ED care, and (4) return instructions. We assessed patient comprehension as the degree of agreement (concordance) between patients' recall of each of these domains and information obtained from chart review. Two authors scored each case independently and discussed discrepancies before providing a final concordance rating (no concordance, minimal concordance, partial concordance, near concordance, complete concordance). \n Seventy-eight percent of patients demonstrated deficient comprehension (less than complete concordance) in at least 1 domain; 51% of patients, in 2 or more domains. Greater than a third of these deficiencies (34%) involved patients' understanding of post-ED care, whereas only 15% were for diagnosis and cause.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: The criteria for administration of adjuvant radiation therapy after thymoma resection remains controversial, and it is unclear whether patients with Masaoka stage III thymoma benefit from adjuvant radiation. The goal of this report was to determine whether or not this group benefits from radiation therapy in disease-specific survival and disease-free survival. \n Case records of the Massachusetts General Hospital were retrospectively reviewed from 1972 to 2004. One hundred and seventy-nine patients underwent resection for thymoma, of which 45 had stage III disease. \n Forty-five stage III patients underwent resection and in 36 it was complete. Thirty-eight stage III patients received radiation therapy. Baseline prognostic factors between radiated and nonradiated groups were similar. The addition of adjuvant radiotherapy did not alter local or distant recurrence rates in patients with stage III thymoma. Disease-specific survival at 10 years in stage III patients who did not receive radiation was 75% (95% confidence interval, 32% to 100%) and in patients who did receive radiation therapy it was 79% (95% confidence interval, 64% to 94%) (p = 0.21).

Risk-adjusted generalized linear models assessed for differences in hospital cost and length of stay (LOS) among children managed by (1) non-children's teaching hospitals (NCTHs), (2) children's teaching hospitals (CTHs), and (3) nonteaching hospitals (NTHs). Risk-adjusted logistic regression compared the odds of major perioperative complications (hemorrhage, respiratory failure, death). Models accounted for clustering of patients within hospitals, were weighted to provide national estimates, and controlled for comorbidities. \n The 25,685 tonsillectomies recorded in the KID yielded a national estimate of 40,591 inpatient tonsillectomies performed in 2006, 2009, and 2012.

Therefore, we examined whether CIMT differed significantly among individuals with distinct cardiovascular phenotype and correlated significantly with traditional cardiovascular risk factors in a black African population. \n CIMT was measured in 456 subjects with three distinct cardiovascular phenotypes - 175 consecutive Nigerian African stroke patients, 161 hypertensive patients without stroke and 120 normotensive non-smoking adults. For each pair of cardiovascular phenotypes, c-statistics were obtained for CIMT and traditional vascular risk factors (including age, gender, weight, waist circumference, smoking, alcohol, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, fasting plasma glucose, fasting total cholesterol). Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify bivariate relationships. \n Bilaterally, CIMT was significantly different among the three cardiovascular phenotypes (right: p\u2009<\u20090.001, F\u2009=\u200933.8; left: p\u2009<\u20090.001, F\u2009=\u200948.6). CIMT had a higher c-statistic for differentiating stroke versus normotension (c\u2009=\u20090.78 right; 0.82 left, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and hypertension versus normotension (c\u2009=\u20090.65 right; 0.71 left, p\u2009<\u20090.001) than several traditional vascular risk factors.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Lifestyle changes over the last 30 years are the most likely explanation for the increase in allergic disease over this period.AIM: This study tests the hypothesis that the consumption of fast food is related to the prevalence of asthma and allergy. \n As part of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) a cross-sectional prevalence study of 1321 children (mean age = 11.4 years, range: 10.1-12.5) was conducted in Hastings, New Zealand. Using standard questions we collected data on the prevalence of asthma and asthma symptoms, as well as food frequency data. Skin prick tests were performed to common environmental allergens and exercise-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) was assessed according to a standard protocol. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height2 (kg/m2) and classified into overweight and obese according to a standard international definition. \n After adjusting for lifestyle factors, including other diet and BMI variables, compared with children who never ate hamburgers, we found an independent risk of hamburger consumption on having a history of wheeze [consumption less than once a week (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06-1.96) and 1+ times a week (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.07-2.52)] and on current wheeze [consumption less than once a week (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.80-1.70) and 1+ times a week (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.10-2.98)].

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Androgen serum levels significantly decrease in older men, causing quality of life impairment and increasing the risk of chronic disease. This disorder is defined as PADAM (Partial Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men). \n To evaluate a PADAM screening tool and determine the prevalence of this disorder in healthy adult men. \n This was a cross-sectional study in which 96 men aged 40 or more of the South Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile were surveyed with the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) questionnaire of the Saint Louis University and sampled for the serum determination of total testosterone, sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Also free and bioavailable testosterone were calculated. PADAM was considered present if items 1 or 7 or any 3 other questions of the ADAM questionnaire were positive. An available testosterone of<198.4 ng/dL was used as a gold standard for the diagnosis of PADAM. \n A total of 78 men (81.3%) were identified as possible PADAM according to the ADAM questionnaire. Total testosterone levels fell from 503.6+/-180.1 ng/dL in men aged 40 to 54 years to 382.1+/-247.3 in those>70 years; however this was not statistically significant (ANOVA, p=0.06). In the same age groups, SHBG significantly increased (31.0+/-15.0 to 47.5+/-15.0 nmol/L, p<0.001) whereas free and available testosterone significantly decreased (10.6+/-3.2 to 6.4+/-3.6 ng/dL and 266.6+/-81.2 to 152.2+/-97.6 ng/dL, respectively, p<0.0001). Overall (n=96), available testosterone confirmed PADAM diagnosis in 27 cases (28.1%). The ADAM tool rendered a 83.3% sensitivity and 19.7% specificity in the detection of PADAM.

A proxy for beta-cell function (basal plasma C peptide/fasting plasma glucose; CP/FPG) was also measured. \n By univariate analysis parity was related to decreased ISI(OGTT) and to increased CP/FPG in those with parity>3 and likewise GDM, diagnosed in 124 women (6.58%), was linearly related to parity (P = 0.0034) and strongly age dependent. The relationships between parity and ISI(OGTT), CP/FPG and GDM were no longer significant after adjustment for age, pregestational body mass index (BMI), and weight gain. GDM was significantly related to age and pregestational weight, while ISI(OGTT) and CP/FPG were inversely related to prepregnancy BMI or weight gain.

Yes, single-agent treatment with mitoxantrone does not differ significantly from combination treatment with FEC in terms of response, objective remission rate, remission duration, time to response, time to best response, time to progression or overall survival. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: To determine whether patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer draw benefit from combination chemotherapy as first-line treatment. \n A total of 260 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer fulfilling high-risk criteria, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, were randomized to receive either mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) or the combination of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC) every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued until complete remission plus two cycles, or until disease progression. In the case of partial remission or stable disease, treatment was stopped after 12 cycles. Second-line treatment was vindesine, mitomycin and prednisolone. Gain from treatment was estimated using a modified Brunner's score composed of time to progression, patients' rating of the treatment benefit, alopecia, vomiting and performance status. \n After recruitment from 1992 to 1997 and observation from 1997 to 1999, the final evaluation showed that single-agent treatment with mitoxantrone does not differ significantly from combination treatment with FEC in terms of response, objective remission rate, remission duration, time to response, time to best response, time to progression or overall survival.

However, these studies are cross-sectional and do not inform the association between neck pain and future HRQoL. \n The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between increasing grades of neck pain severity and HRQoL 6 months later. In addition, this longitudinal study examines the crude association between the course of neck pain and HRQoL. \n This is a population-based cohort study. \n Eleven hundred randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults were included. \n Outcome measures were the mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summary (PCS) of the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. \n We formed a cohort of 1,100 randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults in September 1995. We used the Chronic Pain Questionnaire to measure neck pain and its related disability. The SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure physical and mental HRQoL 6 months later. Multivariable linear regression was used to measure the association between graded neck pain and HRQoL while controlling for confounding. Analysis of variance and t tests were used to measure the crude association among four possible courses of neck pain and HRQoL at 6 months. The neck pain trajectories over 6 months were no or mild neck pain, improving neck pain, worsening neck pain, and persistent neck pain. Finally, analysis of variance was used to examine changes in baseline to 6-month PCS and MCS scores among the four neck pain trajectory groups. \n The 6-month follow-up rate was 74.9%.

There were 249 outpatients (178 men and 71 women; mean age, 44.4 years \u00b1 14.6; range, 15-79) who underwent MRa and were enrolled in this study. Patients were excluded if they had received surgery of the shoulder before MRa, had undergone repeated MRa of the same shoulder, and/or had undergone MRa of both shoulders on the same day. Patients were randomly assigned into one of three groups. Patients in group A (n=61) received skin infiltration with local anesthesia. Patients in control group B (n=92) and group C (n=96) did not receive local anesthesia. Pain levels were immediately assessed after the injection for MRa using a horizontal visual analog scale (VAS) that ranged from 0 to 10. To compare the pain scores of the three groups for male and female patients, a two-way analysis of variance was used. A p-value equal to or less than 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant result. \n Patients who received local anesthesia (group A) showed a mean pain level on the VAS of 2.6 \u00b1 2.3. In patients who did not receive local anesthetics (groups B and C), a mean pain level on the VAS of 2.6 \u00b1 2.2 and 2.7 \u00b1 2.4 were detected, respectively.

Revised Bethesda Criteria recommend that patients with two HNPCC-associated cancers undergo molecular evaluation to determine whether they have a mismatch repair (MMR) defect associated with HNPCC. The purpose of our study was to determine the likelihood of MMR defects (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1) in women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer. \n Between 1989 and 2004, 102 women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers were identified; 59 patients had tumor blocks available for analysis. Patients were divided into risk groups based on family history: high (met Amsterdam criteria), medium (personal history or first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer), and low (all others). Protein expression for MSH2, MSH6, and MLH1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Microsatellite instability and MLH1 promoter methylation analyses were performed on a subset of cases. \n Median age was 50 years. Two patients met Amsterdam criteria for HNPCC.

The contrast enhancement was measured in inflamed synovial tissue at half dose (0.05 mmol per kilogram of body weight) and at full dose (0.1 mmol/kg) by using T1-weighted sequences with fat saturation. The differences and the correlation of signal intensities (SIs) at half- and full-dose sequences were compared by using the paired t test and Pearson correlations. Image quality, Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI Score (RAMRIS), and tenosynovitis score on half- and full-dose images were compared by two observers using the Wilcoxon test. Interrater agreement was assessed by using \u03ba statistics. \n A significant difference in SI was found between half-dose and full-dose gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced synovial tissue (mean: 914.35 \u00b1 251.1 vs 1022 \u00b1 244.5, P<.001).

We analyzed whether the age, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, medication (vitamin B12), type of the most atrophic and impaired muscle, the muscle strength at the presentation, the presence of the pyramidal tract sign, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, including the presence and number of T2 high signal intensity areas (T2 HIA) in the spinal cord and the conversion to surgery were associated with the recovery of muscle strength in the patients. In addition, we also investigated whether the duration of symptoms before surgery and the type of surgery were associated with the recovery of muscle strength in patients who required conversion to surgical treatment. \n The presence of T2 HIA on MRI (P=0.002), the number of T2 HIA on MRI (P=0.002) and conversion to surgery (P=0.015) were found to be significantly associated with a poorer recovery at the observational final follow-up.

After the evoked motor response was obtained, a solution of 10 mL 2% lidocaine with epinephrine and 10 mL 0.75% ropivacaine (actual final concentration of epinephrine, 1/160,000) was slowly injected through the needle. Sensory and motor blocks were assessed every 5 min for 30 min by an anesthesiologist blinded to the elicited motor response. If the block was not complete 30 min after injection of the local anesthetics, it was considered as failed, and general anesthesia was supplemented. \n Time to perform the block and level of minimal and maximal stimulation were not different between groups.

The current study assesses whether there was any change in the contributions of calories, essential elements, proportion of fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and fiber in children who were diagnosed with celiac diseases, comparing the diet with gluten prior one year after diagnosis with the diet without gluten to the year of diagnosis. The level of clinical or analytical impact that nutritional deficits could have was also assessed. \n A prospective,descriptive, observational study in which information was collected from a dietary survey, anthropometric and analytical data at pre-diagnosis of celiac disease and following a gluten diet and one year after celiac disease diagnosis, under gluten-free diet. \n A total of 37 patients meet the study criteria. A decrease in the intake of saturated fatty acids was found, with an increase of monounsaturated fatty acids and an increase in the intake of phosphorus in the diet without gluten. A deficient intake of vitamin D was found in both diets. Clinically, at year of gluten-free diet there was an improvement in weight and size.

    "Let's think step by step. No, the region is not yet ready to cope with such a challenging issue. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Recent studies have shown that early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation results in significant HIV transmission reduction. This is the rationale behind the \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization (WHO). Implementation of this policy will lead to an increased incidence of ART-related adverse effects, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Is the region yet ready to cope with such a challenging issue? \n The introduction and widespread use of ART have drastically changed the natural history of HIV/AIDS, but exposure to ART leads to serious medication-related adverse effects mainly explained by mitochondrial toxicities, and the situation will get worse in the near future. Indeed, ART is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, lipodystrophy, prediabetes and overt diabetes, insulin resistance and hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis. The prevalence of these disorders is already high in SSA, and the situation will be exacerbated by the implementation of the new WHO recommendations. Most SSA countries are characterized by (extreme) poverty, very weak health systems, inadequate and low quality of health services, inaccessibility to existing health facilities, lack of (qualified) health personnel, lack of adequate equipment, inaccessibility and unaffordability of medicines, and heavy workload in a context of a double burden of disease. Additionally, there is dearth of data on the incidence and predictive factors of ART-related adverse effects in SSA, to anticipate on strategies that should be put in place to prevent the occurrence of these conditions or properly estimate the upcoming burden and prepare an adequate response plan. These are required if we are to anticipate and effectively prevent this upcoming burden. \n Antiretroviral therapy related adverse effects: Can sub-Saharan Africa cope with the new \"test and treat\" policy of the World Health Organization?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n(a) Yes: The first question is whether SSA is ready to cope with the new WHO recommendations.

The patients were categorized into age groups 45 to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85 years and older, then further categorized by treatment status. Kaplan-Meier analysis of disease-specific survival (DSS) for late-stage (III and IV) OPSCC was performed for all age and treatment categories, followed by a multivariate cox regression of treatment status, tumor site, race, stage, and sex per age group. \n A total of 14,909 patients with OPSCC were identified. In our demographic data, we observed a significant increase in the number of patients who did not receive treatment (surgery, radiation, or combined therapy) after age 55. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that age groups 65 to 74 and 75 to 84 had substantial benefits in DSS with surgery, radiation, or combined therapy.

Schizophrenia patients with high intelligence have atypical IQ and atypical symptoms. Schizophrenia patients with high intelligence are a clinically distinct sub-type of schizophrenia. So, the answer is a. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Schizophrenia patients are typically found to have low IQ both pre- and post-onset, in comparison to the general population. However, a subgroup of patients displays above average IQ pre-onset. The nature of these patients' illness and its relationship to typical schizophrenia is not well understood. The current study sought to investigate the symptom profile of high-IQ schizophrenia patients. \n We identified 29 schizophrenia patients of exceptionally high pre-morbid intelligence (mean estimated pre-morbid intelligence quotient (IQ) of 120), of whom around half also showed minimal decline (less than 10 IQ points) from their estimated pre-morbid IQ. We compared their symptom scores (SAPS, SANS, OPCRIT, MADRS, GAF, SAI-E) with a comparison group of schizophrenia patients of typical IQ using multinomial logistic regression. \n The patients with very high pre-morbid IQ had significantly lower scores on negative and disorganised symptoms than typical patients (RRR=0.019; 95% CI=0.001, 0.675, P=0.030), and showed better global functioning and insight (RRR=1.082; 95% CI=1.020, 1.148; P=0.009).

Its effect on the adequacy of patient informed consent, procedure acceptance and the impact on subsequent communication/transfer of procedure results to the patient have not been evaluated. The aim of our study was to compare the extent of preknowledge of procedures and test explanation, patient medical complexity, information transfer and overall patient satisfaction between a patient group referred for outpatient open access endoscopy versus a patient group from a gastrointestinal (GI) subspecialty clinic. \n Information was obtained from all patients presenting for outpatient upper and lower endoscopy by using a 1-page questionnaire. Patients from the two groups who had an outpatient upper/lower endoscopic procedure were contacted by phone after the procedure to obtain information with a standardized questionnaire. \n The open access patients reported receiving significantly less information to help them identify the procedure (p<0.01) and less explanation concerning the nature of the procedure than the group of patients referred from the subspecialty clinic (p<0.005).

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether myocardial SPECT should be used for screening HIV-infected patients with no clinical symptoms of coronary artery disease. \n The prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT was determined in 94 HIV-infected patients with a normal clinical cardiovascular examination in relation to anthropomorphic parameters, CRFs, inflammatory and HIV infection status, and treatment. \n Coronary artery disease was detected in nine patients (eight with ischaemia, one with myocardial infarction), corresponding to 9.6 % positivity. All but two of the scintigraphic diagnoses of ischaemia were confirmed by coronarography. Univariate analysis revealed that the overall number of CRFs and the combination of gender and age were associated with a diagnosis of SMI (p<0.05). According to multivariate analysis, the only independent parameter significantly associated with the scintigraphic diagnosis of SMI was the combination of gender and age (p = 0.01). All the positive myocardial SPECT scans were in men older than 52 years with at least two other CRFs.

From patient medical records, we extracted demographic data, clinical measurements, and outcomes during emergency department evaluation and subsequent hospitalization. Data regarding serum sickness were not collected. \n Primary outcome variables were the occurrence of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to antivenin, the type of reaction, permanent disability at hospital discharge, and mortality. \n We identified a total of 73 patients with rattlesnake bites during the study period. Bite envenomation was graded as nonenvenomated, 7 patients (10%); mild, 23 patients (32%); moderate, 32 patients (44%); and severe, 11 patients (15%). We identified 65 patients who received antivenin. Antivenin doses ranged from 1 to 30 vials per patient (mean, 12.0 +/- 6.0), for a total of 777 vials. In 43 patients (66%), 10 or more vials of antivenin were given. The mean number of vials of antivenin given to each snakebite grade were as follows: mild, 8.4 (+/-4.0); moderate, 11.8 (+/-5.7); and severe, 18.7 (+/-6.3). No deaths, amputations, or permanent disability from snakebite occurred in the patients receiving antivenin. Acute side effects of antivenin-occurring within the first 6 hours after administration-were seen in 12 patients (18%; 95% confidence interval, 10%-30%). Acute side effects consisted solely of urticaria in all but 1 patient (2%; 95% confidence interval, 0%-8%).

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Cancer of the buccal mucosa is an uncommon and aggressive neoplasm of the oral cavity. Less than 2% of patients treated for cancer of the oral cavity at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) from 1971 to 1997 had primary buccal cancers. Because the majority of these patients did not undergo any adjuvant treatment, this group provided us with the opportunity to assess the relationship between margin status and local recurrence for both small (T1-T2) and large (T3-T4) tumors treated with surgery alone. \n The RPCI tumor registry database reported 104 patients who were treated for buccal carcinoma. A retrospective chart review identified 27 patients who met our criteria for a buccal mucosal primary tumor (epicenter of the mass in the buccal mucosa). There were 13 men and 14 women, ranging in age from 34 to 94 years (mean, 75). Data were collected regarding patient demographics, presenting symptoms, stage, treatment received, and outcome. \n All patients underwent surgical resection of their primary lesion; 21 (75%) had T1 or T2 tumors. The rate of local recurrence was 56% for the group as a whole.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ). \n Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test. \n Seventy-five patients were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57).

Recently, it was questioned whether training of mid- to higher level cadres in public health prepared graduates with competencies to strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Measuring educational impact has been notoriously difficult; therefore, innovative methods for measuring the outcome and impact of MPH programs were sought. Impact was conceptualized as \"impact on workplace\" and \"impact on society,\" which entailed studying how these competencies were enacted and to what effect within the context of the graduates' workplaces, as well as on societal health. \n This is part of a larger six-country mixed method study; in this paper, the focus is on the qualitative findings of two English language programs, one a distance MPH program offered from South Africa, the other a residential program in the Netherlands. Both offer MPH training to students from a diversity of countries. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 graduates (per program), working in low- and middle-income health systems, their peers, and their supervisors. \n Impact on the workplace was reported as considerable by graduates and peers as well as supervisors and included changes in management and leadership: promotion to a leadership position as well as expanded or revitalized management roles were reported by many participants. The development of leadership capacity was highly valued amongst many graduates, and this capacity was cited by a number of supervisors and peers. Wider impact in the workplace took the form of introducing workplace innovations such as setting up an AIDS and addiction research center and research involvement; teaching and training, advocacy, and community engagement were other ways in which graduates' influence reached a wider target grouping. Beyond the workplace, an intersectoral approach, national reach through policy advisory roles to Ministries of Health, policy development, and capacity building, was reported. Work conditions and context influenced conduciveness for innovation and the extent to which graduates were able to have effect.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Increased aortic stiffness is a independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension. Acute changes of the heart rate (HR) have been reported not to affect the aortic stiffness in pacing. However, it is unknown whether acute changes in HR caused by sympathomimetics can affect the aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension. We investigated the effect of acute changes in HR produced by isoproterenol on the aortic stiffness in 17 hypertensive patientss (mean age: 59 +/- 9 years). \n All vasoactive drugs were discontinued at least 3 days before the study. The carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by the foot-to-foot method. The pulse waves were recorded at the baseline and at every increase of HR by 5 to 10 bpm with a gradual increase of the dose of isoproterenol. The blood pressures and HR were measured simultaneously. For the analysis, HR, PWV, compliance (C), and compliance index (Ci) were converted as percent changes (delta) from the baseline values. Percent changes of the parameters of the aortic stiffness, i.e., deltaPWV, deltaC, and deltaCi, were grouped by every 10% increase in deltaHR. \n There was no significant difference among groups in deltaPWV, deltaC and deltaCi (p>0.05 for each of the group). The regression analysis showed no significant correlation of deltaHR with deltaPWV and deltaC (r = 0.18, 0.13 respectively, p>0.05 for each). deltaCi had a poor correlation with deltaHR (r = 0.22, p<0.05).

The control group consisted of 44 women who applied to the clinic for a routine gynaecological check-up, without chronic disease or a history of medication use. Owing to the fact that it would affect thrombocyte function, women who have the following conditions were excluded from the study: women who were taking anticoagulant therapy, oral contraceptives, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory medications and who had chronic diseases. The leukocyte count, platelet count, neutrophil ratio and MPV values were collected from PID and the control group. C reactive protein values of patients with PID were also noted. \n MPV values in patients with PID were lower than those in the control group. This reduction in MPV is statistically significant when the PID patient group is compared with the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.001).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: To analyze the reliability of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to assess bone density and the microstructure of the maxillary bones at the alveolar process in human clinics by direct comparison with conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry. \n Analysis of osseous microstructural variables including bone volumetric density (BV/TV) of 39 biopsies from the maxillary alveolar bone was performed by micro-CT. Conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry of 10 bone biopsies was performed by optic microscopy (OM) and low-vacuum surface electronic microscopy (SEM). Percentages of bone between micro-CT and conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry were compared. \n Significant positive correlations were observed between BV/TV and the percentage of bone (%Bone) analyzed by SEM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.933, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), by toluidine blue staining OM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.950, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and by dark field OM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.667, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). The high positive correlation coefficient between BV/TV and trabecular thickness illustrates that a value of BV/TV upper than 50% squares with a bone presenting most of their trabecules thicker than 0.2\u00a0mm. The high negative correlation between BV/TV and trabecular separation shows that values of BV/TV upper than 50% squares with a bone presenting most of their trabecules separated less than 0.3\u00a0mm each other. \n Is micro-computed tomography reliable to determine the microstructure of the maxillary alveolar bone?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nStep 1:\nThe first step is to define the microstructure of the maxillary alveolar bone.\nStep 2:\nThe second step is to compare the microstructure of the maxillary alveolar bone obtained by micro-CT with the microstructure of the maxillary alveolar bone obtained by conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry.\nStep 3:\nThe third step is to evaluate the reliability of micro",
    "Let's think step by step. No, frozen section analysis did not alter the surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Frozen section (FS) evaluation during thyroid surgery is often used to guide intraoperative management. We sought to determine the utility of FS in patients undergoing thyroidectomy for multinodular thyroid disease. \n From May 1994 through November 2004, 236 patients with multinodular goiter underwent thyroidectomy at our institution. Patient data were retrospectively analyzed to see if a frozen section was performed during the procedure and whether it changed the patient's outcome. \n Of the 236 patients, 135 (57%) had intra-operative FS. There were no differences between patients who had FS analysis and those who did not with regard to age, gender, and the incidence of malignancy. Of the patients who had FS, 4/135 (3%) were subsequently diagnosed with thyroid cancer on permanent histology. Three of these FS were misread as benign. Therefore, the sensitivity of FS for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer was only 25%. Importantly, in none of the 135 patients did FS alter the intraoperative management. \n Does frozen section alter surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe first question is whether frozen section analysis is useful in multinodular goiter.\nThe second question is whether frozen section analysis alters the surgical management.\nThe third question is whether frozen section analysis is useful in multinodular goiter.\nThe fourth question is whether frozen section analysis alters the surgical management.\nThe fifth question is whether frozen section analysis is useful in multinodular goiter.\nThe sixth question is whether",
    "Let's think step by step. Yes, the lack of any measurable norfentanyl in half of our cases suggests a very rapid death, consistent with acute chest rigidity. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: There has been a significant spike in fentanyl-related deaths from illicit fentanyl supplied via the heroin trade. Past fentanyl access was primarily oral or dermal via prescription fentanyl patch diversion. One factor potentially driving this increase in fatalities is the change in route of administration. Rapid intravenous (IV) fentanyl can produce chest wall rigidity. We evaluated post-mortem fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations in a recent surge of lethal fentanyl intoxications. \n Fentanyl related deaths from the Franklin County coroner's office from January to September 2015 were identified. Presumptive positive fentanyl results were confirmed by quantitative analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and were able to quantify fentanyl, norfentanyl, alfentanyl, and sufentanyl. \n 48 fentanyl deaths were identified. Mean fentanyl concentrations were 12.5\u2009ng/ml, (range 0.5\u2009ng/ml to\u2009>40\u2009ng/ml). Mean norfentanyl concentrations were 1.9\u2009ng/ml (range none detected to 8.3\u2009ng/ml). No appreciable concentrations of norfentanyl could be detected in 20 of 48 cases (42%) and were less than 1\u2009ng/ml in 25 cases (52%). Elevated fentanyl concentrations did not correlate with rises in norfentanyl levels. In several cases fentanyl concentrations were strikingly high (22\u2009ng/ml and 20\u2009ng/ml) with no norfentanyl detected. \n The lack of any measurable norfentanyl in half of our cases suggests a very rapid death, consistent with acute chest rigidity. An alternate explanation could be a dose-related rapid onset of respiratory arrest. Deaths occurred with low levels of fentanyl in the therapeutic range (1-2\u2009ng/ml) in apparent non-na\u00efve opiate abusers. Acute chest wall rigidity is a well-recognized complication in the medical community but unknown within the drug abuse community. The average abuser of illicit opioids may be unaware of the increasing fentanyl content of their illicit opioid purchase. \n Could chest wall rigidity be a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nWe are told that there has been a significant spike in fentanyl-related deaths from illicit fentanyl supplied via the heroin trade.

Yet, only limited studies have been done and a great deal of literature related to this intervention is anecdotal. The present study aims at providing additional quantitative evidence on the potential of dogs to positively modulate the behavior of children with ASD.SETTINGS/ \n A 12-year-old boy diagnosed with ASD was exposed, at his usual treatment location (the Portuguese Association for Developmental Disorders and Autism at Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal), to the following treatment conditions: (1) one-to-one structured activities with a therapist assisted by a certified therapy dog, and (2) one-to-one structured activities with the same therapist alone (as a control). To accurately assess differences in the behavior of the participant between these treatment conditions, the therapist followed a strict research protocol. The behavior of the participant was continuously video-recorded during both treatment conditions for further analysis and comparison.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Vancomycin is the primary treatment for infections caused by methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The association of vancomycin treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers. \n The aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis. \n A total of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively.

All pregnancies underwent nuchal translucency (NT) screening at 11-14 weeks' gestation. Pregnancies were dated by accurate last menstrual period consistent with crown-rump length (CRL) measurements at the time of screening, early pregnancy CRL or date of fertilization. The association between birth weight and the difference between the measured and the expected CRL at the time of NT screening was analyzed. \n The difference between measured and expected CRL, expressed both in mm and in days of gestation, was statistically greater in the severely macrosomic neonates compared with controls (mean, 6.66 +/- 4.78 mm vs. 1.17 +/- 4.6 mm, P<0.0001 and 3 +/- 2.2 days vs. 0.5 +/- 2.3 days, P<0.0001, respectively).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: To determine the advantages of scrotal incision in the treatment of undescended testis. Undescended testis is a common pediatric condition and is conventionally managed surgically by orchidopexy. A single scrotal incision orchidopexy has become accepted as a valid approach for patients with palpable undescended testicles. Because this approach also allows easy detection of atrophic testes or testicular remnants, it recently has also emerged as an alternative initial surgical approach to impalpable undescended testicles. \n All orchidopexies performed between 2004 and 2008 at our university hospital were prospectively included in this study. A total of 194 scrotal orchidopexies were performed in 154 patients (mean age, 71 months; range, 4-229 months). In all cases a scrotal approach was chosen irrespective of the initial position or presence of an open processus vaginalis. Testicular position was examined at follow-up after a mean period of 10 months (3-22 months). \n Overall, 36 of the 46 impalpable testicles (78%) could be diagnosed and treated accordingly, using only a scrotal incision. Conversion to laparoscopy was needed in 4 cases. A limited number of postoperative complications were seen. In all cases, the testes were palpable and remained in the scrotum on follow-up. \n Scrotal approach to both palpable and impalpable undescended testes: should it become our first choice?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe scrotal approach is an excellent option in the management of palpable undescended testes.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: More than 50,000 new HIV infections occur annually in the United States. Injection drug users represent twelve percent of incident HIV infections each year. Pharmacy sales of over-the-counter (OTC) syringes have helped prevent HIV transmission among injection drug users in many states throughout the United States. However, concerns exist among some law enforcement officials, policymakers, pharmacists, and community members about potential links between OTC syringe sales and crime. \n We used a geographic information system and novel spatial and longitudinal analyses to determine whether implementation of pharmacy-based OTC syringe sales were associated with reported crime between January 2006 and December 2008 in Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts. We assessed reported crime pre- and post-OTC syringe sales initiation as well as longitudinal associations between crime and OTC syringe-selling pharmacies. \n By December 2008, 9.3% (94/1010) of Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts had at least one OTC syringe-selling pharmacy. Overall reported crime counts and reported crime rates decreased between 2006 and 2008 in all 1010 Reporting Districts. Using generalized estimating equations and adjusting for potential confounders, reported crime rates were negatively associated with OTC syringe sales (adjusted rate ratio: 0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.81, 0.99). \n Is crime associated with over-the-counter pharmacy syringe sales?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n(1) There were 1010 Reporting Districts in Los Angeles, CA.\n(2) There were 94 pharmacies that sold OTC syringes.\n(3) 9.3% (94/1010) of Los Angeles Police Department Reporting Districts had at least one OTC syringe-selling pharmacy.\n(4) Overall reported crime counts and reported crime rates decreased",

Thus, the answer is (c) maybe\n\nQ: : A previous hip fracture more than doubles the risk of a contralateral hip fracture. Pharmacologic and environmental interventions to prevent hip fracture have documented poor compliance. The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip to prevent contralateral hip fracture. \n : A Markov state-transition model was used to evaluate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for unilateral fixation of hip fracture alone (including internal fixation or arthroplasty) compared with unilateral fixation and contralateral prophylactic hip fixation performed at the time of hip fracture or unilateral fixation and bilateral hip pad protection. Prophylactic fixation involved placement of a cephalomedullary nail in the uninjured hip and was initially assumed to have a relative risk of a contralateral fracture of 1%. Health states included good health, surgery-related complications requiring a second operation (infection, osteonecrosis, nonunion, and malunion), fracture of the uninjured hip, and death. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimated as cost per QALY gained in 2006 US dollars with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below $50,000 per QALY gained considered cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of patient age, annual mortality and complication rates, intervention effectiveness, utilities, and costs on the value of prophylactic fixation. \n : In the baseline analysis, in a 79-year-old woman, prophylactic fixation was not found to be cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $142,795/QALY). However, prophylactic fixation was found to be a cost-effective method to prevent contralateral hip fracture in: 1) women 71 to 75 years old who had 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture; and 2) women younger than age 70 years.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: To correlate magnetic resonance (MR) image findings with pain response by provocation discography in patients with discogenic low back pain, with an emphasis on the combination analysis of a high intensity zone (HIZ) and disc contour abnormalities. \n Sixty-two patients (aged 17-68 years) with axial low back pain that was likely to be disc related underwent lumbar discography (178 discs tested). The MR images were evaluated for disc degeneration, disc contour abnormalities, HIZ, and endplate abnormalities. Based on the combination of an HIZ and disc contour abnormalities, four classes were determined: (1) normal or bulging disc without HIZ; (2) normal or bulging disc with HIZ; (3) disc protrusion without HIZ; (4) disc protrusion with HIZ. These MR image findings and a new combined MR classification were analyzed in the base of concordant pain determined by discography. \n Disc protrusion with HIZ [sensitivity 45.5%; specificity 97.8%; positive predictive value (PPV), 87.0%] correlated significantly with concordant pain provocation (P<0.01). A normal or bulging disc with HIZ was not associated with reproduction of pain. Disc degeneration (sensitivity 95.4%; specificity 38.8%; PPV 33.9%), disc protrusion (sensitivity 68.2%; specificity 80.6%; PPV 53.6%), and HIZ (sensitivity 56.8%; specificity 83.6%; PPV 53.2%) were not helpful in the identification of a disc with concordant pain. \n Can magnetic resonance imaging accurately predict concordant pain provocation during provocative disc injection?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n(1) What is the question?\nThe question is: To correlate magnetic resonance (MR) image findings with pain response by provocation discography in patients with discogenic low back pain, with an emphasis on the combination analysis of a high intensity zone (HIZ) and disc contour abnormalities.\n(2) What is the hypothesis?\nThe hypothesis is that the MR image findings can accurately predict concordant pain provocation during provocative",

No, the results of the study showed no significant difference between the two groups in knee extensor and flexor torque, hamstring/Quadriceps ratio, position sense, and physical performance. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Bicompartmental knee arthroplasty features bone and ligament sparing as unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and is presumably better in the recovery of muscle strength and function compared to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) though not previously reported in the literature. The aim of the study was to compare isokinetic knee muscle strength and physical performance in patients who underwent either bicompartmental knee arthroplasty or TKA. \n Each of 24 patients (31 knees) was prospectively examined preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months after each surgery. Isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength as well as position sense were measured using the Biodex system. Timed up and go test, stair climbing test, and the 6-min walk test were used to assess physical performance. The results of each group were also compared with those from the corresponding healthy control, respectively. \n Demography showed significant difference in the mean age between bicompartment (54.8 \u00b1 5.6 years) and TKA groups (65.7 \u00b1 6.7 years). Comparing between the two groups, knee extensor and flexor torque, hamstring/Quadriceps ratio, position sense, and physical performance were not significantly different preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months after surgery. In intra-group analysis, muscle strength and position sense at each time point were not different in both groups.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, beta E levels were inversely correlated with anxiety day 1 and day 14 of alcohol withdrawal. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Associations between several psychopathological alterations and lowered beta-endorphin(beta E) plasma levels have already been stated in former studies. However, whereas single measures during static conditions generally failed in linking beta E levels with psychopathology, dynamic changes of beta E in particular have been shown to be associated with spells of anxiety and depression. During alcohol withdrawal, a decreased secretion of beta E with a delayed normalization has been reported, but up to now only few data became available regarding the interaction of plasma beta E and psychopathological parameters. \n The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis whether beta E during acute alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety, depression, and craving. \n We observed self-rated anxiety, depression, and craving during alcohol withdrawal and assessed beta E levels (RIA) in a consecutive sample of 60 alcoholics on day 1 and day 14 after onset of withdrawal, and in 30 healthy volunteers. To control for mutual interactions of beta E and the pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion, plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol were also determined. \n In accordance with prior studies, beta E was significantly lowered on day 1 and day 14 of alcohol withdrawal relative to controls. Plasma levels of ACTH correlated significantly with beta E in alcoholics at both time points and in controls, without differing significantly between the groups. Self-rated anxiety, depression, and alcohol craving decreased significantly between day 1 and day 14. Levels of beta E were inversely correlated with anxiety day 1 (r=-0.58) and day 14 (r=-0.71). Partial correlation coefficients controlling for ACTH plasma levels revealed that this correlation was largely independent from ACTH. In addition, a significant inverse relationship was found between beta E and craving on day 14 (r=-0.28).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Complex regional pain syndrome type I is treated symptomatically. A protective effect of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) has been reported previously. A dose-response study was designed to evaluate its effect in patients with wrist fractures. \n In a double-blind, prospective, multicenter trial, 416 patients with 427 wrist fractures were randomly allocated to treatment with placebo or treatment with 200, 500, or 1500 mg of vitamin C daily for fifty days. The effect of gender, age, fracture type, and cast-related complaints on the occurrence of complex regional pain syndrome was analyzed. \n Three hundred and seventeen patients with 328 fractures were randomized to receive vitamin C, and ninety-nine patients with ninety-nine fractures were randomized to receive a placebo. The prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome was 2.4% (eight of 328) in the vitamin C group and 10.1% (ten of ninety-nine) in the placebo group (p=0.002); all of the affected patients were elderly women. Analysis of the different doses of vitamin C showed that the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome was 4.2% (four of ninety-six) in the 200-mg group (relative risk, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.13 to 1.27), 1.8% (two of 114) in the 500-mg group (relative risk, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.77), and 1.7% (two of 118) in the 1500-mg group (relative risk, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.04 to 0.75).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Digoxin is a commonly used medication for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias that has recently been suggested as a novel chemotherapeutic agent. Preclinical studies of prostate cancer (PCa) have shown anti-tumor activity with digoxin. We explore the relationship between use of digoxin and PCa risk. \n Data from a population-based case-control study of incident cases aged 35-74 years at PCa diagnosis in 2002-2005 in King County, Washington were available. Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk was evaluated with logistic regression. \n One thousand one cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, race, PSA screening, and family history of PCa, digoxin use was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of PCa (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.30-1.10). Among those with \u22653 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years (546 cases, 380 controls), digoxin use was associated with a stronger reduction of PCa risk (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98). \n Is digoxin use for cardiovascular disease associated with risk of prostate cancer?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n(1) It is a common medication used for heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias.\n(2) It has recently been suggested as a novel chemotherapeutic agent.\n(3) Preclinical studies of prostate cancer (PCa) have shown anti-tumor activity with digoxin.\n(4) We explore the relationship between use of digoxin and PCa risk.\n(5) Data from a population-",

Although this was a great step, wide clinical application was limited by several factors. Bariatric surgery such as gastric bypass is emerging as a promising option in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this article is to explore the current application of gastric bypass in patients with type 2 diabetes and the theoretical bases of gastric bypass as a treatment option for type 1 diabetes. \n We performed a MEDLINE search for articles published from August 1955 to December 2008 using the words \"surgical treatment of diabetes,\" \"etiology of diabetes\" and \"gastric bypass.\" \n We identified 3215 studies and selected 72 relevant papers for review. Surgical treatment of diabetes is evolving from complex pancreatic and islets transplantation surgery for type 1 diabetes with critical postoperative outcome and follow-up to a metabolic surgery, including gastric bypass. Gastric bypass (no immune suppression or graft rejection) has proven to be highly effective treatment for obese patients and nonobese animals with type 2 diabetes. There are certain shared criteria between types 1 and 2 diabetes, making a selected spectrum of the disease a potential target for metabolic surgery to improve or cure diabetes. \n Can Roux-en-Y gastric bypass provide a lifelong solution for diabetes mellitus?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nWe are looking for an option that can be used in patients with diabetes.\nBariatric surgery such as gastric bypass is emerging as a promising option in obese patients with type 2 diabetes.\nSo, the answer is a.\n# 142.

The optimal CPAP pressure increases with an increase in OSA severity from 7.79 +/- 2.2 in the mild, to 8.7 +/- 1.8 in the moderate, and to 10.1 +/- 2.3 cm H2O in the severe OSA group. A high CPAP was defined as the mean + 1 standard deviation (SD;>or =12 cm H2O). The predictor variables included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). High CPAP was required in 2 (6.9%), 6 (5.8%), and 63 (28.6%) patients with mild, moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. On univariate analysis, AHI, BMI, ESS score, and the proportion of males were significantly higher in those needing high CPAP. They also have a lower MSLT mean. On logistic regression, the use of high CPAP was 5.90 times more frequent (95% confidence interval 2.67-13.1) in severe OSA patients after adjustment for the other variables.

It remains unclear how best to achieve this and what characterises good practice in increasingly multicultural societies across Europe. This study assessed the views and values of professionals working in different health care contexts and in different European countries as to what constitutes good practice in health care for immigrants. \n A total of 134 experts in 16 EU Member States participated in a three-round Delphi process. The experts represented four different fields: academia, Non-Governmental Organisations, policy-making and health care practice. For each country, the process aimed to produce a national consensus list of the most important factors characterising good practice in health care for migrants. \n The scoring procedures resulted in 10 to 16 factors being identified as the most important for each participating country. All 186 factors were aggregated into 9 themes: (1) easy and equal access to health care, (2) empowerment of migrants, (3) culturally sensitive health care services, (4) quality of care, (5) patient/health care provider communication, (6) respect towards migrants, (7) networking in and outside health services, (8) targeted outreach activities, and (9) availability of data about specificities in migrant health care and prevention. Although local political debate, level of immigration and the nature of local health care systems influenced the selection and rating of factors within each country, there was a broad European consensus on most factors.

In women with PCOS, metformin co-treatment during IVF has been shown to increase pregnancy rates and reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether metformin co-treatment before and during IVF can also increase the live birth rate (LBR) and lower severe OHSS rates for women with PCO, but no other manifestations of PCOS. \n This study was a double-blind, multi-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The study population included 134 women with ovulatory PCO (and no evidence of clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism) undergoing IVF treatment at three tertiary referral IVF units. The primary outcome was LBR. \n In total, 134 women were randomized, 69 to metformin and 65 to placebo. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics. With regard to IVF outcome, no significant improvements were found in the metformin group when compared with the placebo group. In particular, there was no difference between the groups in rates of live birth [metformin n = 27 (39.1%), placebo n = 30 (46.2), (95% confidence interval 0.38, 1.49, odds ratio = 0.75)], clinical pregnancy [metformin n = 29 (42.0%), placebo n = 33 (50.8%)]or severe OHSS [metformin n = 6 (8.7%), placebo n = 5 (7.7%)]. \n Do women with ovaries of polycystic morphology without any other features of PCOS benefit from short-term metformin co-treatment during IVF?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nWe know that the primary outcome was LBR.\nThe first thing we should do is to look at the p value of the primary outcome.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Limited and conflicting data exist on an association between mammographic density (MD) and re-excision rates after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Additionally, the correlation of MD with resection of unnecessary margins during initial BCS is unknown. \n All women with a diagnosis of breast cancer from 2003 to 2012 and enrolled in a larger study on MD were evaluated. Operative and pathology reports were reviewed to determine margin resection and involvement. Mammographic density was determined both by breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) classification and by an automated software program (Volpara Solutions). Additional margins were deemed unnecessary if the lumpectomy specimen margin was free of invasive tumor [\u22652 mm for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)] or if further re-excision was needed. \n Of 655 patients, 398 (60.8%) had BCS, whereas 226 (34.5%) underwent initial mastectomy. The women with denser breasts (BI-RADS 3 or 4) underwent initial mastectomy more frequently than the women with less dense breasts (40.0 vs. 30.5%, respectively; p = 0.0118). Of the patients with BCS, 166 (41.7%) required separate re-excision. Additional margins were taken during BCS in 192 (48.2%) patients, with 151 (78.6%) proving to be unnecessary. In the bivariable analysis, the patients with denser breasts according to BI-RADS classification and volumetric density showed a trend toward requiring more frequent re-excision, but this association was not seen in the multivariable analysis. The rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast density. In the multivariate analysis, the re-excision rates increased with DCIS (p<0.0003) and decreased with resection of additional margins (p = 0.0043). \n Does Mammographic Density have an Impact on the Margin Re-excision Rate After Breast-Conserving Surgery?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n1.

No exclusion criteria were based on the size, number, or location of myomas. \n Laparoscopic myomectomy and modifications of the technique: enucleation of the myoma by morcellation while it is still attached to the uterus with and without earlier devascularization. \n In all, 912 myomas were removed in these 505 patients laparoscopically. The mean number of myomas removed was 1.85 +/- 5.706 (95% CI 1.72-1.98). In all, 184 (36.4%) patients had multiple myomectomy. The mean size of the myomas removed was 5.86 +/- 3.300 cm in largest diameter (95% CI 5.56-6.16 cm). The mean weight of the myomas removed was 227.74 +/- 325.801 g (95% CI 198.03-257.45 g) and median was 100 g. The median operating time was 60 minutes (range 30-270 minutes). The median blood loss was 90 mL (range 40-2000 mL). Three comparisons were performed on the basis of size of the myomas (<10 cm and>or=10 cm in largest diameter), number of myomas removed (<or=4 and>or=5 myomas), and the technique (enucleation of the myomas by morcellation while the myoma is still attached to the uterus and the conventional technique). In all these comparisons, although the mean blood loss, duration of surgery, and hospital stay were greater in the groups in which larger myomas or more myomas were removed or the modified technique was performed as compared with their corresponding study group, the weight and size of removed myomas were also proportionately larger in these groups. Two patients were given the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma in their histopathology and 1 patient developed a diaphragmatic parasitic myoma followed by a leiomyoma of the sigmoid colon.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Endometrial polyp is a common cause of abnormal uterine bleeding, but the etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is angiogenic, related to thick walled vessels and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) is related to fibrotic tissue, which are characteristics of endometrial polyps. The primary objective of this study was to find out if endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of VEGF or TGF-\u03b21, or both. A secondary objective is to determine if the changes are related to steroid receptor expression. \n This prospective study compared VEGF and TGF-\u03b21 expression of endometrial polyps and adjacent endometrial tissue in 70 premenopausal women. The comparison of results was separately made for endometrium specimens obtained in the proliferative and secretory phases. The results were correlated with the steroid receptors (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) expression. \n The score of VEGF in glandular cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium, both in the proliferative phase (P<0.001) and the secretory phase (P=0.03); the score of VEGF in stromal cells of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium only in proliferative phase (P=0.006).

Recent evidence suggests that discontinuing NA therapy may be feasible in selected patients. \n To analyze the rate of virological relapse in patients with HBeAg-negative CHB who discontinued treatment with NAs. \n We performed a single-center observational study that included 140 patients with HBsAg-negative CHB. Twenty-two patients, who received only NAs, discontinued treatment for different reasons and were subsequently monitored. All had normal ALT and AST, undetectable DNA and absence of cirrhosis or significant comorbidities before stopping treatment. \n Twelve patients showed virologic relapse (54.54%). The mean interval between discontinuation and relapse was 6.38 months (\u00b1 1.9) (75% relapsed during the first 12 months after discontinuation). Five received adefovir, 1 lamivudine and adefovir, 1 tenofovir and 5 lamivudine alone. The mean treatment duration in this group was 38.5 months (\u00b1 4.5).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: To determine whether the risk of secondary breast cancer after radiotherapy (RT) for Hodgkin's disease is greater among women who underwent RT around time of pregnancy. \n The records of 382 women treated with RT for Hodgkin's disease were reviewed and divided into those who received RT around the time of pregnancy and those who were not pregnant. Comparisons of the overall incidence, actuarial rates, and latency to breast cancer between the two groups were made. Multivariate Cox regression modeling was performed to determine possible contributing factors. \n Of the 382 women, 14 developed breast cancer (3.7%). The increase in the overall incidence (16.0% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.0001) and the actuarial rate of breast cancer among the women in the pregnant group (p = 0.011) was statistically significant. The women treated around the time of pregnancy had a 10- and 15-year actuarial rate of breast cancer of 6.7% and 32.6%, respectively. The 10-year and 15-year actuarial rate for the nonpregnant women was 0.4% and 1.7%, respectively. The median latency from RT to the diagnosis of breast cancer was 13.1 and 18.9 years for women in the pregnant and nonpregnant groups, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, pregnancy around the time of RT was the only variable associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The risk was dependent on the length of time from pregnancy to RT, with women receiving RT during pregnancy and within 1 month of pregnancy having an increased risk of breast cancer compared with nonpregnant women and women irradiated later than 1 month after pregnancy (hazard ratio, 22.49; 95% confidence interval, 5.56-90.88; p<0.001). \n Does radiotherapy around the time of pregnancy for Hodgkin's disease modify the risk of breast cancer?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n1.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Precursor events are undesirable events that can lead to a subsequent adverse event and have been associated with postoperative mortality. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether precursor events are associated with a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, acute renal failure, stroke, infection) in a low- to medium-risk coronary artery bypass grafting, valve, and valve plus coronary artery bypass grafting population. These events might be targets for strategies aimed at quality improvement. \n The present study was a retrospective cohort design performed at the Queen Elizabeth Health Science Centre. Low- to medium-risk patients who had experienced postoperative MACE were matched 1:1 with patients who had not experienced postoperative MACE. The operative notes, for both groups, were scored by 5 surgeons to determine the frequency of 4 precursor events: bleeding, difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, repair or regrafting, and incomplete revascularization or repair. A univariate comparison of \u22651 precursor events in the matched groups was performed. \n A total of 311 MACE patients (98.4%) were matched.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: The aims of the study were to report the rates of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma following primary CAT surgery and to report the rate of conversion to a modified radical mastoidectomy. \n This was a retrospective review of a single surgeon series between 2006 and 2012. \n In total 132 second-look operations were undertaken, with a mean interval between primary surgery and second-look procedures of 6 months. The rate of cholesteatoma at second-look surgery was 19.7%, which was split into residual disease (10.6%) and recurrent disease (9.09%). New tympanic membrane defects with cholesteatoma were considered as recurrent disease. Residual disease was defined as cholesteatoma present behind an intact tympanic membrane. The majority of recurrent and residual disease was easily removed at second look (73.1%).

    "Let's think step by step. No, the FDA warning period did not significantly change the trend of AED prescription claims. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: In January 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) communicated concerns and, in May 2009, issued a warning about an increased risk of suicidality for all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). This research evaluated the association between the FDA suicidality communications and the AED prescription claims among members with epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder. \n A longitudinal interrupted time-series design was utilized to evaluate Oklahoma Medicaid claims data from January 2006 through December 2009. The study included 9289 continuously eligible members with prevalent diagnoses of epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder and at least one AED prescription claim. Trends, expressed as monthly changes in the log odds of AED prescription claims, were compared across three time periods: before (January 2006 to January 2008), during (February 2008 to May 2009), and after (June 2009 to December 2009) the FDA warning. \n Before the FDA warning period, a significant upward trend of AED prescription claims of 0.01% per month (99% CI: 0.008% to 0.013%, p<0.0001) was estimated. In comparison to the prewarning period, no significant change in trend was detected during (-20.0%, 99% CI: -70.0% to 30.0%, p=0.34) or after (80.0%, 99% CI: -20.0% to 200.0%, p=0.03) the FDA warning period.

This study aimed to investigate whether there is a relationship between plasma levels of leptin and phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, and its potential relevance in the vascular remodeling in obese patients. \n The study was performed in 164 obese and 94 normal-weight individuals (controls). NADPH oxidase activity was evaluated by luminescence in phagocytic cells. Levels of leptin were quantified by ELISA in plasma samples. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured by ultrasonography. In addition, we performed in-vitro experiments in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine macrophages. \n Phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity and leptin levels were enhanced (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. NADPH oxidase activity positively correlated with leptin in obese patients. This association remained significant in a multivariate analysis. cIMT was higher (P<0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. In addition, cIMT also correlated positively with leptin and NADPH oxidase activity in obese patients. In-vitro studies showed that leptin induced NADPH oxidase activation. Inhibition of the leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activity by wortmannin and bisindolyl maleimide suggested a direct involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase C pathways, respectively.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Mossy fibers are the sole excitatory projection from dentate gyrus granule cells to the hippocampus, forming part of the trisynaptic hippocampal circuit. They undergo significant plasticity during epileptogenesis and have been implicated in seizure generation. Mossy fibers are a highly unusual projection in the mammalian brain; in addition to glutamate, they release adenosine, dynorphin, zinc, and possibly other peptides. Mossy fiber terminals also show intense immunoreactivity for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and immunoreactivity for GAD67. The purpose of this review is to present physiologic evidence of GABA release by mossy fibers and its modulation by epileptic activity. \n We used hippocampal slices from 3- to 5-week-old guinea pigs and made whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from CA3 pyramidal cells. We placed stimulating electrodes in stratum granulosum and adjusted their position in order to recruit mossy fiber to CA3 projections. \n We have shown that electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons. These inhibitory signals satisfy the criteria that distinguish mossy fiber-CA3 synapses: high sensitivity to metabotropic glutamate-receptor agonists, facilitation during repetitive stimulation, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-independent long-term potentiation. \n Do mossy fibers release GABA?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nFirst of all, the mossy fibers are the sole excitatory projection from dentate gyrus granule cells to the hippocampus, forming part of the trisynaptic hippocampal circuit.\nMossy fibers are a highly unusual projection in the mammalian brain; in addition to glutamate, they release adenosine, dynorphin, zinc, and possibly other peptides.\n",

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: To our knowledge there are no evidence-based medicine data to date to critically judge the vulnerability of a solitary kidney to warm ischemia compared to paired kidneys. \n Ten dogs were exposed to open right nephrectomy to create a solitary kidney model (group 1). Ten dogs with both kidneys were considered group 2. All dogs underwent warm ischemia by open occlusion of the left renal artery for 90 minutes. Dogs were sacrificed at different intervals (3 days to 4 weeks). All dogs were reevaluated by renogram before sacrifice and histopathology of the investigated kidney. The proinflammatory markers CD95 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. \n In group 1 clearance decreased by 20% at 1 week but basal function was regained starting at week 2. In group 2 clearance decreased more than 90% up to week 2. Recovery started at week 3 and by 4 weeks there was a 23% clearance reduction. Histopathological examination in group 1 revealed significant tubular necrosis (60%) at 3 days with regeneration starting at 1 week.

Fluoridation's effect on restorative dental demand among 972 Washington state employees and spouses, aged 20 to 34 years, in two fluoridated communities and a nonfluoridated community was examined. \n At baseline, adults were interviewed by telephone, and oral assessments were conducted to measure personal characteristics, lifetime exposure to fluoridated water, oral disease, and the quality of restorations. Adults were followed for 2 years to measure dental demand from dental claims. Each adult's baseline and claims data were linked with provider and practice variables collected from the dentist who provided treatment. \n Relative to adults with no lifetime exposure to fluoridated water, adults drinking fluoridated water for half or more of their lives had less disease at baseline and a lower but nonsignificant probability of receiving a restoration in the follow-up period. In the 2-year follow-up period, however, more than half of the restorations were performed to replace fillings of satisfactory or ideal quality at baseline. When only teeth with decay and unsatisfactory fillings at baseline were considered, adults with high fluoridation exposure had a lower probability of receiving a restoration than adults with no exposure. Market effects also were detected in demand equations; relative to adults in the nonfluoridated community, adults residing in the fluoridated community with a large dentist supply received a greater number of restorations, suggesting potential supplier-induced demand from less disease and fewer patients. \n Does fluoridation reduce the use of dental services among adults?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\n(c) maybe llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe authors determine whether prevention influences the use of health services.

Knee pain at Y15 was assessed by questionnaire. Associations between BMI over 14 years and knee pain at Y15 were examined using logistic regression. \n BMI significantly increased from Y1 to Y15 (P<0.0005) with medians (interquartile ranges) of 24.5 kg/m(2)  (22.5-27.2 kg/m(2) ) and 26.5 kg/m(2)  (23.9-30.1 kg/m(2) ), respectively. At Y15, 45.1% of subjects had knee pain. A greater BMI at Y1 (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]1.05-1.69), at Y15 (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.10-1.61), and change in BMI over 15 years (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.00-1.93) were significant predictors of knee pain at Y15 (P<0.05).

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Trauma centers are designated to provide systematized multidisciplinary care to injured patients. Effective trauma systems reduce patient mortality by facilitating the treatment of injured patients at appropriately resourced hospitals. Several U.S. studies report reduced mortality among patients admitted directly to a level I trauma center compared with those admitted to hospitals with less resources. It has yet to be shown whether there is an outcome benefit associated with the \"level of hospital\" initially treating severely injured trauma patients in Australia. This study was designed to determine whether the level of trauma center providing treatment impacts mortality and/or hospital length of stay. \n Outcomes were evaluated for severely injured trauma patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS)>15 using NSW Institute of Trauma and Injury Management data from 2002-2007 for our regional health service. To assess the association between trauma centers and binary outcomes, a logistic regression model was used. To assess the association between trauma centers and continuous outcomes, a multivariable linear regression model was used. Sex, age, and ISS were included as covariates in all models. \n There were 1,986 trauma presentations during the 6-year period. Patients presenting to a level III trauma center had a significantly higher risk of death than those presenting to the level I center, regardless of age, sex, ISS, or prehospital time.

The safety and the effectiveness of endoaortic occlusion have not been documented in this setting. \n Endoaortic occlusion was employed in 52 of 2,172 consecutive patients. Surgeon's choice was based on preoperative identification of aortic calcifications or intraoperative epiaortic ultrasonographic scanning. Deaths and strokes were analyzed casewise and in aggregate. \n In 10 patients (19.2%), the endoaortic balloon had to be replaced by the ordinary cross-clamp because of incomplete occlusion (n = 5), hindered exposure (n = 2), or balloon rupture (n = 3). In-hospital death occurred in 13 patients (25%), and stroke on awakening from anesthesia in 2 (3.8%). The death rate of patients treated by endoaortic occlusion was significantly higher compared with all other patients (4.2%, p<0.0001) and with the expected estimate by European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (10.5%, p = 0.05). By multivariable analysis, use of endoaortic occlusion was independently associated with in-hospital death (odds ratio = 5.609, 95% confidence interval: 2.684 to 11.719).

Findings on TB patients' treatment adherence vary across existing literature and official reports. The present study attempted to determine the actual treatment adherence of new TB patients and to identify factors leading to non-adherence. \n A prospective cohort of 481 newly confirmed TB patients from three counties in western China were enrolled during June to December 2012 and was followed until June 2013. Patients who missed at least one dose of drugs or one follow-up re-examination during the treatment course were deemed as non-adherent. Influencing factors were identified using a logistic regression model. \n A total of 173 (36.0 %) patients experienced non-adherence and the loss to follow-up cases reached 136 (28.2 %). Only 13.9 % of patients took drugs under direct observation, and 60.5 % of patients were supervised by phone calls.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique lumbar spine radiographs are often a standard part of the evaluation of children who are clinically suspected of having spondylolysis. Recent concerns regarding radiation exposure and costs have brought the value of oblique radiographs into question. The purpose of the present study was to determine the diagnostic value of oblique views in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. \n Radiographs of fifty adolescents with L5 spondylolysis without spondylolisthesis and fifty controls were retrospectively reviewed. All controls were confirmed not to have spondylolysis on the basis of computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, or bone scanning. Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique radiographs of the lumbar spine were arranged into two sets of slides: one showing four views (anteroposterior, lateral, right oblique, and left oblique) and one showing two views (anteroposterior and lateral only). The slides were randomly presented to four pediatric spine surgeons for diagnosis, with four-view slides being presented first, followed by two-view slides. The slides for twenty random patients were later reanalyzed in order to calculate of intra-rater agreement. A power analysis demonstrated that this study was adequately powered. Inter-rater and intra-rater agreement were assessed on the basis of the percentage of overall agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). PCXMC software was used to generate effective radiation doses. Study charges were determined from radiology billing data. \n There was no significant difference in sensitivity and specificity between four-view and two-view radiographs in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. The sensitivity was 0.59 for two-view studies and 0.53 for four-view studies (p = 0.33). The specificity was 0.96 for two-view studies and 0.94 for four-view studies (p = 0.60). Inter-rater agreement, intra-rater agreement, and agreement with gold-standard ICC values were in the moderate range and also demonstrated no significant differences. Percent overall agreement was 78% for four-view studies and 82% for two-view studies. The radiation effective dose was 1.26 mSv for four-view studies and 0.72 mSv for two-view studies (difference, 0.54 mSv).

Patients requiring surgical extraction of a single impacted third molar and who fell within the inclusion criteria and indicated willingness to return for recall visits were recruited. The predictor variable was application of PRP gel to the socket of the third molar in the test group, whereas the control group had no PRP. The outcome variables were pain, swelling, and maximum mouth opening, which were measured using a 10-point visual analog scale, tape, and millimeter caliper, respectively. Socket healing was assessed radiographically by allocating scores for lamina dura, overall density, and trabecular pattern. Quantitative data were presented as mean.
