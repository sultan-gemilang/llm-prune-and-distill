    "No, loop domains are eliminated upon cohesin loss. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Cohesin Loss Eliminates All Loop Domains. \n The human genome folds to create thousands of intervals, called \"contact domains,\" that exhibit enhanced contact frequency within themselves. \"Loop domains\" form because of tethering between two loci-almost always bound by CTCF and cohesin-lying on the same chromosome. \"Compartment domains\" form when genomic intervals with similar histone marks co-segregate. Here, we explore the effects of degrading cohesin. All loop domains are eliminated, but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected. Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation but does affect a significant minority of active genes. \n cohesin loss eliminates all loop domains \n Are loop domains preserved upon cohesin loss?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n\n\"Cohesin loss eliminates all loop domains.\" (Paragraph)\nThis sentence implies that loop domains are present in the genome only when cohesin is present. When cohesin is lost, all loop domains are eliminated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (b) no. Loop domains are not preserved upon cohesin loss.",

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: An analysis of publicly available data from the Phase II studies for bapineuzumab and solanezumab indicates that neither compound produced compelling evidence of drug-like behavior that would justify their progression into pivotal trials.  \n Notably, a recent study of solanezumab, an amyloid \u03b2 monoclonal antibody, raises hope for the further therapeutic potential of immunotherapy, not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also for other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease.  \n For example, Eli Lilly announced a major change to its closely watched clinical trial for the Alzheimer's drug solanezumab which failed to reach statistical significance.  \n Areas covered: This contradiction prompted us to review all study phases of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG), Bapineuzumab, Solanezumab, Avagacestat and Dimebolin to shed more light on these recent failures.  \n  Results from phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with two monoclonal antibodies bapineuzumab and solanezumab and intravenous immunoglobulin have been disappointing. Subsequent analysis of pooled data from both phase III trials with solanezumab showed a reduction in cognitive decline in patients with mild AD. \n Secondary analyses of EXPEDITION studies suggested a smaller functional effect of solanezumab relative to cognition. An increasing effect of solanezumab over 18\u00a0months was shown for cognition and function. \n RESULTS: In the mild AD population, less cognitive and functional decline was observed with solanezumab (n\u00a0=\u00a0659) versus placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a0663), measured by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living functional scale Instrumental ADLs.  \n The promising results obtained with aducanumab and solanezumab against Alzheimer's disease (AD) strengthen the vaccine approach to prevent AD, despite of the many clinical setbacks.  \n CONCLUSIONS: Solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds amyloid, failed to improve cognition or functional ability.  \n Results from phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with two monoclonal antibodies bapineuzumab and solanezumab and intravenous immunoglobulin have been disappointing. \n Is Solanezumab effective for Alzheimer's Disease?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nAccording to the text, the results from the phase III clinical trials of solanezumab were disappointing.

inflammatory disorders, and has shown efficacy in psoriasis, psoriatic arthropathies, and Beh\u00e7et's syndrome. \n oral ulcers the hallmark of beh\u00e7et s syndrome can be resistant to conventional treatment therefore alternative agents are needed apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor that modulates several inflammatory pathways we conducted a phase 2 multicenter placebo controlled study in which 111 patients with beh\u00e7et s syndrome who had two or more oral ulcers were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg of apremilast twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks this regimen was followed by a 12 week extension phase in which the placebo group was switched to apremilast and a 28 day post treatment observational follow up phase the patients and clinicians were unaware of the study assignments throughout the trial the primary end point was the number of oral ulcers at week 12 secondary outcomes included pain from these ulcers measured on a 100 mm visual analogue scale with higher scores indicating worse pain the number of genital ulcers overall disease activity and quality of life the mean sd number of oral ulcers per patient at week 12 was significantly lower in the apremilast group than in the placebo group 0 5 1 0 vs 2 1 2 6 p 0 001 the mean decline in pain from oral ulcers from baseline to week 12 was greater with apremilast than with placebo 44 7 24 3 mm vs

respectively among 56 patients findings that were similar to those in previous studies of apremilast there were two serious adverse events in patients receiving apremilast apremilast was effective in treating oral ulcers which are the cardinal manifestation of beh\u00e7et s syndrome this preliminary study was neither large enough nor long enough to assess long term efficacy the effect on other manifestations of beh\u00e7et s syndrome or the risk of uncommon serious adverse events funded by celgene clinicaltrials gov number nct00866359. \n current trends in the management of beh\u00e7et s syndrome will be reviewed in this article biologic agents have gained increasing importance over the years in the management of beh\u00e7et s syndrome long term results of observational studies have shown that anti tumor necrosis factor agents may be effective in beh\u00e7et s syndrome patients with refractory eye involvement case series reporting about use of anti tumor necrosis factor agents in vascular and gastrointestinal involvement have also shown good results caution is required for infectious complications with these agents apremilast is an immunomodulatory agent that works through phosphodiesterase 4 inhibition a randomized controlled trial has shown that it is effective for the management of oral and genital ulcers and is generally well tolerated the outcome of beh\u00e7et s

    "Let's think step by step. No, splicing speckles contain little detectable transcriptional activity. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: We show here that RNA splicing speckled domains (splicing speckles) fluctuate in constrained nuclear volumes and remodel their shapes. \n We present a model where recycling splicing factors return as part of small sub-speckles from distal sites of RNA processing to larger splicing speckles by a directed ATP-driven mechanism through interchromatin spaces. \n Analysis of a HeLa cell line stably expressing EYFP-NHPX showed that the nucleolar accumulation of NHPX was preceded by its transient accumulation in splicing speckles. \n In vivo analysis of NHPX reveals a novel nucleolar localization pathway involving a transient accumulation in splicing speckles. \n \"Splicing speckles\" are major nuclear domains rich in components of the splicing machinery and polyA(+) RNA. Although speckles contain little detectable transcriptional activity, they are found preferentially associated with specific mRNA-coding genes and gene-rich R bands, and they accumulate some unspliced pre-mRNAs \n RNA polymerase II transcribes mRNAs and is required for splicing, with some reports suggesting that the inactive complexes are stored in splicing speckle \n In normal cell growth conditions GFPeIF4A-III was mainly nucleoplasmic, but in hypoxia stress conditions it moved to the nucleolus and splicing speckles. \n Localization of eIF4A-III in the nucleolus and splicing speckles is an indicator of plant stress. \n  Using antibodies raised against mouse RBM6 to immunostain mammalian cell lines we found that the endogenous protein was both distributed diffusely in the nucleus and concentrated in a small number of nuclear foci that corresponded to splicing speckles/interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs \n Subnuclear targeting of the RNA-binding motif protein RBM6 to splicing speckles and nascent transcripts. \n Are splicing speckles associated with transcription?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n\nThe passage mentions that splicing speckles are major nuclear domains rich in components of the splicing machinery and polyA(+) RNA, and that they are found preferentially associated with specific mRNA-coding genes and gene-rich R bands. However, the passage does not mention anything about transcription. Therefore, the answer is (b) no.",
    "Let's think step by step. No, Enzastaurin did not improve survival of glioblastoma patients. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056).  \n Enzastaurin (LY317615) in combination with bevacizumab for recurrent malignant gliomas is well-tolerated, with response and progression-free survival similar to bevacizumab monotherapy. \n So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis nor at recurrent disease. \n Despite promising phase II clinical trial results and patient benefit in terms of clinical improvement and longer progression-free survival, an overall survival benefit has not been demonstrated in four randomized phase III trials of bevacizumab or cilengitide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma or cediranib or enzastaurin in recurrent glioblastoma. \n EXPERT OPINION: Enzastaurin and cediranib failed in randomized Phase III trials in recurrent glioblastoma, aflibercept

angiogenesis antiangiogenic treatment likely achieves a beneficial impact through multiple mechanisms of action ultimately however alternative proangiogenic signal transduction pathways are activated leading to the development of resistance even in tumors that initially respond the identification of biomarkers or imaging parameters to predict response and to herald resistance is of high priority despite promising phase ii clinical trial results and patient benefit in terms of clinical improvement and longer progression free survival an overall survival benefit has not been demonstrated in

Yes, CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ:  The loss of CD55 and CD59 renders PNH erythrocytes susceptible to intravascular haemolysis, which can lead to thrombosis and to much of the morbidity and mortality of PNH.  \n CD55 Deficiency, Early-Onset Protein-Losing Enteropathy, and Thrombosis. \n CONCLUSIONS: CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55.  \n It is caused by the expansion of a hematopoietic progenitor cell that has acquired a mutation in the X-linked phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) gene that results in deficiency of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor structure responsible for fixing a wide spectrum of proteins particularly CD55 and CD59. The clinical features of this disease arise as a result of complement-mediated hemolysis in unprotected red cells, leukocytes, and platelets as well as the release of free hemoglobin. Patients may present with a variety of clinical manifestations, such as anemia, thrombosis, kidney disease, smooth muscle dystonias, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and extreme fatigue. \n The lack of one of the GPI-AP complement regulatory proteins (CD55, CD59) leads to hemolysis. The disease is diagnosed with hemolytic anemia, marrow failure and thrombosis. \n Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare bone marrow failure disorder that manifests with hemolytic anemia, thrombosis, and peripheral blood cytopenias. The absence of two glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, CD55 and CD59, leads to uncontrolled complement activation that accounts for hemolysis and other PNH manifestations. \n RESULTS: CD55 and/or CD59 deficiencies were found in 1.6% (2/127) of patients with primary BCS, 1.0% (1/100) of non-malignant and non-cirrhotic patients with PVT, and 4.7% (4/85) of cirrhotic patients with PVT. \n Data of this study indicate that the PNH defect as detected with CD55, CD59, and CD16 is not an important cause of intra-abdominal thrombosis in northwestern India. \n PNH testing of red blood cells revealed a CD55 and CD59 deficiency consistent with PNH in both cases. The systemic complications typically associated with thrombosis were not observed for the following several months with early conservative treatments including eculizumab. \n Deficiency of the GPI-anchored complement inhibitors CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes leads to intravascular hemolysis upon complement activation. Apart from hemolysis, another prominent feature is a highly increased risk of thrombosis. \n Genetic reconstitution of CD55 or treatment with a complement-inhibitory therapeutic antibody reversed abnormal complement activation.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55. \n Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal disorder characterized by a decrease or absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored molecules such as CD55 and CD59 from the surface of affected cells, resulting in intravascular hemolysis, cytopenia, and venous thrombosis. \n CONCLUSIONS CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55. \n CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55. \n CD55 Deficiency, Early-Onset Protein-Losing Enteropathy, and Thrombosis. \n Can CD55 deficiency cause thrombosis?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nThe passage states, \"CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55.\" This implies that a deficiency in CD55 leads to abnormal complement activation, which can cause thrombosis.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, obstructive sleep apnea and snoring are associated with cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest arrhythmia in clinical practice and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common breathing disorder, is an independent risk factor for AF. \n There is a growing consensus in the scientific community that suggests a strong association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and cardiovascular (CVD) conditions and events, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death.  \n part from well-established risk factors that increase the odds for the development of AF, e.g. age or arterial hypertension, recent analyses indicate that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may independently, negatively modify the arrhythmia occur-rence profile.  \n Evidence supports a causal association of sleep apnea with the incidence and morbidity of hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, and stroke. \n Severe snoring may be associated with pulmonary and systemic hypertension, secondary polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias.<br> \n Severe snoring may be associated with pulmonary and systemic hypertension, secondary polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. \n BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), reportedly as a consequence of the autonomic effects of recurrent apnea with subsequent oxygen desaturation. \n Obstructive apnea is associated with myocardial ischemia (silent or symptomatic), acute coronary events, stroke and transient ischemic attacks, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. \n Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, affecting 5-15% of the population. It is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep that disrupts normal ventilation and sleep architecture, and is typically associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and witnessed apneas. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea present risk to the general public safety by causing 8-fold increase in vehicle accidents, and they may themselves also suffer from the physiologic consequences of OSA; these include hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias \n Obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration                     are associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia.  \n Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects approximately 4% of middle-aged men and 2% of middle-aged women. Cardiac arrhythmias are common problems in patients with OSA, even though the true prevalence and clinical relevance of cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined.  \n Cardiac arrhythmias during wakefulness and sleep in 15 patients with sleep-induced obstructive apnea, and the effect of atropine and tracheostomy on these arrhythmias were studied by continuous overnight Holter electrocardiographic, respiratory and electroencephalographic recordings. \n obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as its most extreme variant, is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway, leading to cessation of breathing while asleep. Cardiac arrhythmias are common problems in OSA patients, although the true prevalence and clinical relevance of cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined \n The mechanisms associated with the cardiovascular consequences of obstructive sleep apnea include abrupt changes in autonomic tone, which can trigger cardiac arrhythmias.  \n  Recent studies have shown that cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disorders are common in patients with SA. Sleep apnea \n Severity of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias correlates with intensity of sleep apnea in men \n Patients affected with OSA are frequently hypertensive and can have dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. \n Patients with stable cardiac failure who snore may present sleep hypopnea and cardiac arrhythmias.  \n  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cardiac arrhythmias are common in patients with OSA.  \n Nocturnal hypoxia has been associated with serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias as well as life-threatening bradyarrhythmias. Obesity and snoring, both of which increase with age, have been identified as risk factors for sleep-related breathing disorders, as have hypertension and heart disease. \n Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with excess daytime sleepiness, depression, and an increased incidence of ischemic cardiopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, systemic hypertension and brain infarction. \n We found 58 percent prevalence of arrhythmias in patients with sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index = AHI>10), vs 42 percent in nonapneic controls (chi 2 = 16.7, p<0.0001) \n Are sleep apnea and snoring associated with cardiac arrhythmias?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nAccording to the passage, sleep apnea and snoring are associated with cardiac arrhythmias.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, IL11 is a crucial determinant of cardiovascular fibrosis. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: IL11 is a crucial determinant of cardiovascular fibrosis. \n Using integrated imaging-genomics analyses of primary human fibroblasts, we found that Interleukin 11 (IL11) upregulation is the dominant transcriptional response to TGFB1 exposure and required for its profibrotic effect. IL11 and its receptor (IL11RA) are expressed specifically in fibroblasts where they drive non-canonical, ERK-dependent autocrine signalling that is required for fibrogenic protein synthesis. In mice, fibroblast-specific Il11 transgene expression or Il11 injection causes heart and kidney fibrosis and organ failure whereas genetic deletion of Il11ra1 is protective against disease. Thus, inhibition of IL11 prevents fibroblast activation across organs and species in response to a range of important pro-fibrotic stimuli.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Evidence of reduced recombination rate in human regulatory domains. \n We study the relationship between recombination rate and gene regulatory domains, defined by a gene and its linked control elements. We define these links using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), chromatin conformation from publicly available datasets\u00a0(Hi-C and ChIA-PET), and correlated activity links that we infer across cell types. Each link type shows a \"recombination rate\u00a0valley\" of significantly reduced recombination rate compared to matched control regions. This recombination rate\u00a0valley is most pronounced for gene regulatory domains of early embryonic development genes, housekeeping genes, and constitutive regulatory elements, which are known to show increased evolutionary constraint across species. Recombination rate\u00a0valleys show increased DNA methylation, reduced doublestranded break initiation, and increased repair efficiency, specifically in the lineage leading to the germ line. Moreover, by using only the overlap of functional links and DNA methylation in germ cells, we are able to predict the recombination rate with high accuracy.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the existence of a recombination rate valley at regulatory domains and provide a potential molecular mechanism to interpret the interplay between genetic and epigenetic variations. \n Is there increased recombination rate in human regulatory domains?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n\nThe question is asking whether there is an increased recombination rate in human regulatory domains.

Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056).  \n Enzastaurin (LY317615) in combination with bevacizumab for recurrent malignant gliomas is well-tolerated, with response and progression-free survival similar to bevacizumab monotherapy. \n So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis nor at recurrent disease. \n Despite promising phase II clinical trial results and patient benefit in terms of clinical improvement and longer progression-free survival, an overall survival benefit has not been demonstrated in four randomized phase III trials of bevacizumab or cilengitide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma or cediranib or enzastaurin in recurrent glioblastoma. \n CONCLUSIONS: PFS-6 missed the primary planned outcome of 55%.  \n OS (median, 74 weeks) and PFS (median, 36 weeks) results from the current trial were comparable to those from a prior phase II study using erlotinib and were significantly better than those from 2 other previous studies that used thalidomide or cis-retinoic acid, all in combination with temozolomide plus RT.  \n More recently, antiangiogenic agents including enzastaurin, cediranib, bevacizumab, and others that target mainly the VEGF pathway, have been evaluated in this highly angiogenic disease. Among them, only bevacizumab has been associated with clear anti-tumor activity, although the lack of control studies limits the impact of the results to date. \n Enzastaurin has anti-glioma activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, but does not appear to have enough single-agent activity to be useful as monotherapy. \n Several signal transduction inhibitors have been examined in preclinical and clinical malignant glioma trials, including antiangiogenic agents (bevacizumab, enzastaurin), and inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (temsirolimus, everolimus) and integrin (cilengitide). Although preliminary clinical results of the use of targeted agents have not translated into significantly better survival, more recent phase II trials are exploring the combination of multitargeted drugs with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to overcome the resistance of tumors to single-agent targeted therapies. \n Several drugs have been tested, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (temsirolimus and everolimus), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), protein kinase C-beta, and other angiogenesis pathways inhibitors (vatalanib, bevacizumab, and enzastaurin).

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, DNA methylation is correlated with nucleosome occupancy. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Here I show that CpG islands were associated not only with methylation-free promoters but also with nucleosome-free promoters. \n Nucleosome-free regions were observed only in promoters containing a CpG island \n In contrast to the methylation-and nucleosome-free states of CpG-island promoters, exons were densely methylated at CpGs and packaged into nucleosomes. \n I also found that nucleosomes, DNA methylation, and H3K36me3 marked the exons of transcripts with low, medium, and high gene expression levels, respectively. \n Human promoters containing a CpG island tend to remain nucleosome-free as well as methylation-free. \n In contrast, exons demonstrate a high degree of methylation and nucleosome occupancy. \n Exonic DNA methylation seems to function together with exonic nucleosomes and H3K36me3 for the proper splicing of transcripts with different expression levels. \n Supporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns. \n DNA methylation directly silences genes with non-CpG island promoters and establishes a nucleosome occupied promoter. \n Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at CTCF regions that is not present at promoters.  \n Three positions at the splice sites show high CpG abundance and accompany elevated nucleosome occupancy in a leveled GC architecture. \n The first group has higher nucleosome occupancy on exons than introns, whereas the second group exhibits weak nucleosome marking of exons, suggesting another type of epigenetic marker distinguishes exons from introns when GC content is similar. \n  DNA methylation can determine nucleosome positioning.  \n DNA methylation determines nucleosome occupancy in the 5'-CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. \n he induction of DNA hypomethylation events by genetic (DNMT1/DNMT3B deficient cells) or drug (a DNA demethylating agent) approaches is associated with the eviction of nucleosomes from previously hypermethylated CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. \n Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Thus, our results suggest that there is a close association between hypermethylated CpG islands and the presence of nucleosomes, such that each of these epigenetic mechanisms can determine the recruitment of the other. \n Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression. \n Our results indicate that only a minority of demethylated promoters are associated with nucleosome remodeling, and these could potentially be the epigenetic drivers causing the loss of tumorigenicity. \n with repressed genes often being associated with local DNA hypermethylation and gain of nucleosomes at their promoters. \n Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this \"ground state\" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy.  \n In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps (methylomes) of multiple cellular origins. \n The mostly unmethylated CpG islands have reduced nucleosome occupancy and are enriched in cell type-independent binding sites for CTCF. \n In contrast, outside of CpG islands most CpGs are methylated, and the average methylation density oscillates so that it is highest in the linker region between nucleosomes. \n Aberrant acquisition of nucleosomes at enhancer-associated NDRs is associated with hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing marks, and conversely, loss of nucleosomes with demethylation and epigenetic activation. \n Prominent exceptions to the correlations between methylated CpG density and nucleosome occupancy include CpG islands marked by H3K27me3 and CpG-poor heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3, and these modifications, along with DNA methylation, distinguish the major silencing mechanisms of the human epigenome. \n Throughout the genome, nucleosome occupancy was correlated with certain histone methylation or acetylation modifications. \n We further show that the extent of nucleosome depletion at promoters is directly correlated to expression level and can accommodate multiple nucleosomes and provide genome-wide evidence that expressed non-CpG island promoters are nucleosome-depleted. \n Is DNA methylation correlated with nucleosome occupancy?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nThe passage states that \"Human promoters containing a CpG island tend to remain nucleosome-free as well as methylation-free.\" This suggests that there is a correlation between CpG islands and nucleosome-free promoters.\nFurthermore, the passage states that \"Exons demonstrate a high degree of methylation and nucleosome occupancy.\" This suggests that there is a correlation between methylation and",
    "Let's think step by step. Yes, DDX54 regulates transcriptome dynamics during DNA damage response. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: DDX54 regulates transcriptome dynamics during DNA damage response. \n The contribution of post-transcriptional gene regulatory networks to the DNA damage response (DDR) has not been extensively studied. Here, we systematically identified RNA-binding proteins differentially interacting with polyadenylated transcripts upon exposure of human breast carcinoma cells to ionizing radiation (IR). Interestingly, more than 260 proteins, including many nucleolar proteins, showed increased binding to poly(A)+RNA in IR-exposed cells. The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs. Upon IR exposure, DDX54 acts by increased interaction with a well-defined class of pre-mRNAs that harbor introns with weak acceptor splice sites, as well as by protein-protein contacts within components of U2 snRNP and spliceosomal B complex, resulting in lower intron retention and higher processing rates of its target transcripts. Because DDX54 promotes survival after exposure to IR, its expression and/or mutation rate may impact DDR-related pathologies. Our work indicates the relevance of many uncharacterized RBPs potentially involved in the DDR. \n The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs. \n Does DDX54 play a role in DNA damage response?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n\nThe passage states that DDX54 regulates transcriptome dynamics during DNA damage response.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, Logic Alignment Free (LAF) can be used for bacterial genomes classification. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: LAF: Logic Alignment Free and its application to bacterial genomes classification. \n In this paper, we present Logic Alignment Free (LAF), a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in order to assign biological samples to their taxa. This method searches for a minimal subset of k-mers whose relative frequencies are used to build classification models as disjunctive-normal-form logic formulas (if-then rules). We apply LAF successfully to the classification of bacterial genomes to their corresponding taxonomy. In particular, we succeed in obtaining reliable classification at different taxonomic levels by extracting a handful of rules, each one based on the frequency of just few k-mers. State of the art methods to adjust the frequency of k-mers to the character distribution of the underlying genomes have negligible impact on classification performance, suggesting that the signal of each class is strong and that LAF is effective in identifying it. \n In this paper, we present Logic Alignment Free (LAF), a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classification algorithms in order to assign biological samples to their taxa. \n LAF: Logic Alignment Free and its application to bacterial genomes classification. \n Can Logic Alignment Free (LAF) be used for bacterial genomes classification?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe question is asking if LAF can be used for bacterial genomes classification.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: The postnatal functions of the Dlx1&2 transcription factors in cortical interneurons (CINs) are unknown. Here, using conditional Dlx1, Dlx2, and Dlx1&2 knockouts (CKOs), we defined their roles in specific CINs. The CKOs had dendritic, synaptic, and survival defects, affecting even PV+ CINs.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, paralog genes are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Co-regulation of paralog genes in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. \n Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear. In eukaryotes, genes are regulated in part by distal enhancer elements through looping interactions with gene promoters. These looping interactions can be measured by genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments, which revealed self-interacting regions called topologically associating domains (TADs). We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. To test this hypothesis, we integrated paralogy annotations with human gene expression data in diverse tissues, genome-wide enhancer-promoter associations and Hi-C experiments in human, mouse and dog genomes. We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances. Combined, our results indicate that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms and cluster not only in the linear genome but also in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. This enables concerted expression of paralogs over diverse cell-types and indicate evolutionary constraints in functional genome organization. \n Paralog genes arise from gene duplication events during evolution, which often lead to similar proteins that cooperate in common pathways and in protein complexes. Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression \n We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. \n Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs. \n Analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster testes transcriptome reveals coordinate regulation of paralogous genes. \n Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs.<br> \n Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear. \n Co-regulation of paralog genes in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. \n Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs.. \n We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances.  \n MiRNA genes are often subject to co-evolutionary changes together with their target transcripts, which may be reflected by differences between paralog mouse and primate miRNA/mRNA pairs. \n We characterize the collapse over time through the distribution of runs of reduced paralog pairs in duplicated segments. \n In addition, we identified 81 co-regulated regions on the human genome (RIDGEs) by using expression data from all cancers. Some RIDGEs (28%) consist of paralog genes while another subset (30%) are specifically dysregulated in tumors but not in normal tissues. \n We conclude that the similarity of hoxb3a/Hoxa3 regulatory mechanisms reflect the shared descent of both genes from a single ancestral paralog group 3 gene. \n Conserved co-regulation and promoter sharing of hoxb3a and hoxb4a in zebrafish. \n By analyzing paralogs of testis-biased genes, we identified \"co-regulated\" paralogous pairs in which both genes are testis biased, \"anti-regulated\" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other downregulated in testes, and \"neutral\" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other constitutively expressed. \n Are paralog genes co-regulated?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nThe passage states that paralog genes show correlation in gene expression, but the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear.

    "Let's think step by step. No, polyadenylation does not stabilize a protein. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: The addition of poly(A) tails to eukaryotic nuclear mRNAs promotes their stability, export to the cytoplasm and translation.  \n Most eukaryotic genes express mRNAs with alternative polyadenylation sites at their 3' ends \n Polyadenylation is the non-template addition of adenosine nucleotides at the 3'-end of RNA, which occurs after transcription and generates a poly(A) tail up to 250-300 nucleotides long. \n Polyadenylation is a process of endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA, followed by addition of up to 250 adenosine residues to the 3' end of the mRNA. \n Plant mitochondrial polyadenylated mRNAs are degraded by a 3'- to 5'-exoribonuclease activity, which proceeds unimpeded by stable secondary structures. \n We show that a 3'- to 5'-exoribonuclease activity is responsible for the preferential degradation of polyadenylated mRNAs as compared with non-polyadenylated mRNAs, and that 20-30 adenosine residues constitute the optimal poly(A) tail size for inducing degradation of RNA substrates in vitro. \n The diversity of polyadenylation sites suggests that mRNA polyadenylation in prokaryotes is a relatively indiscriminate process that can occur at all mRNA's 3'-ends and does not require specific consensus sequences as in eukaryotes. \n Polyadenylation of premessenger RNAs occurs posttranscriptionally in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells by cleavage of the precursor and polymerization of adenosine residues. \n However, under certain conditions, poly(A) tracts may lead to mRNA stabilization. \n From these results, we propose that in plant mitochondria, poly(A) tails added at the 3' ends of mRNAs promote an efficient 3'- to 5'- degradation process.. \n Auxiliary downstream elements are required for efficient polyadenylation of mammalian pre-mRNAs. \n Transcription in these cells is polycistronic. Tens to hundreds of protein-coding genes of unrelated function are arrayed in long clusters on the same DNA strand. Polycistrons are cotranscriptionally processed by trans-splicing at the 5' end and polyadenylation at the 3' end, generating monocistronic units ready for degradation or translation \n We have devised a simple chromatographic procedure which isolates five polyadenylation factors that are required for polyadenylation of eukaryotic mRNA.  \n During mammalian oocyte maturation, protein synthesis is mainly controlled through cytoplasmic polyadenylation of stored maternal mRNAs. \n Identification and characterization of a polyadenylated small RNA (s-poly A+ RNA) in dinoflagellates. \n Thus, polyadenylation seems to be a major component of the RNA editing machinery that affects overlapping genes in animal mitochondria. \n Pre-mRNA 3'-end processing, the process through which almost all eukaryotic mRNAs acquire a poly(A) tail is generally inhibited during the cellular DNA damage \n Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs possess 3' ends with a polyadenylate (poly(A)) tail. \n We previously demonstrated, by limited mutagenesis, that conserved sequence elements within the 5' end of influenza virus virion RNA (vRNA) are required for the polyadenylation of mRNA in vitro. \n Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors by poly(A) polymerase depends on two specificity factors and their recognition sequences \n The majority of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs are processed by 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation \n Formation of mRNA 3' termini involves cleavage of an mRNA precursor and polyadenylation of the newly formed end.  \n The polyadenylation of RNA is a near-universal feature of RNA metabolism in eukaryotes. \n The mechanism of RNA degradation in Escherichia coli involves endonucleolytic cleavage, polyadenylation of the cleavage product by poly(A) polymerase, and exonucleolytic degradation by the exoribonucleases,  \n The addition of poly(A)-tails to RNA is a process common to almost all organisms.  \n The addition of poly(A) tails to RNA is a phenomenon common to all organisms examined so far.  \n The addition of poly(A)-tails to RNA is a phenomenon common to almost all organisms.  \n Polyadenylation contributes to the destabilization of bacterial mRNA. \n Is polyadenylation a process that stabilizes a protein by adding a string of Adenosine residues to the end of the molecule?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nThe passage says that polyadenylation is a process common to almost all organisms, including eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Here, we identify TIAM1 as a critical antagonist of CRC progression through inhibiting TAZ and YAP, effectors of WNT signaling. We demonstrate that TIAM1 shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus antagonizing TAZ/YAP by distinct mechanisms in the two compartments. In the cytoplasm, TIAM1 localizes to the destruction complex and promotes TAZ degradation by enhancing its interaction with \u03b2TrCP. Nuclear TIAM1 suppresses TAZ/YAP interaction with TEADs, inhibiting expression of TAZ/YAP target genes implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, and invasion, and consequently suppresses CRC cell migration and invasion. Importantly, high nuclear TIAM1 in clinical specimens associates with increased CRC patient survival. Together, our findings suggest that in CRC TIAM1 suppresses tumor progression by regulating YAP/TAZ activity. \n Together, our findings suggest that in CRC TIAM1 suppresses tumor progression by regulating YAP/TAZ activity. \n Nuclear TIAM1 suppresses TAZ/YAP interaction with TEADs, inhibiting expression of TAZ/YAP target genes implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell migration, and invasion, and consequently suppresses CRC cell migration and invasion. \n Using an orthotopic xenograft model in nude mice, we confirmed that Tiam1 silencing could reduce tumor growth by subcutaneous injection and could suppress lung and liver metastases of colorectal cancer cells. \n Together, our findings suggest that in CRC TIAM1 suppresses tumor progression by regulating YAP/TAZ activity.<br> \n Is TIAM1 favoring tumor progression in colorectal cancer (CRC)?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nAccording to the passage, TIAM1 inhibits TAZ and YAP, which are effectors of WNT signaling.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: HUWE1 is a critical colonic tumour suppressor gene that prevents MYC signalling, DNA damage accumulation and tumour initiation. \n To determine the importance of HUWE1, we chose to examine its function in colorectal cancer, where it is mutated in up to 15 per cent of tumours. Modelling of identified mutations showed that they inactivate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HUWE1. Genetic deletion of Huwe1 rapidly accelerated tumourigenic in mice carrying loss of the intestinal tumour suppressor gene Apc, with a dramatic increase in tumour initiation. Mechanistically, this phenotype was driven by increased MYC and rapid DNA damage accumulation leading to loss of the second copy of Apc The increased levels of DNA damage sensitised Huwe1-deficient tumours to DNA-damaging agents and to deletion of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1. Taken together, these data identify HUWE1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium and suggest a potential vulnerability of HUWE1-mutated tumours to DNA-damaging agents and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins. \n Is there any role for HUWE1 in MYC signalling?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nHUWE1 is a critical colonic tumour suppressor gene that prevents MYC signaling, DNA damage accumulation, and tumor initiation.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in late embryonic and postnatal mouse development. Here, we describe a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its function in stem cell fate decisions. By both loss and gain of function approaches we demonstrate that ablation of GRG5 deregulates the Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) pluripotent state whereas its overexpression leads to enhanced self-renewal and acquisition of cancer cell-like properties. The malignant characteristics of teratomas generated by ESCs that overexpress GRG5 reveal its pro-oncogenic potential. \n Here, we describe a previously unknown role of GRG5 in early developmental stages by analyzing its function in stem cell fate decisions. \n Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) is involved in embryonic and neural stem cell state decisions.Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) is a multifunctional protein that has been implicated in late embryonic and postnatal mouse development.  \n Does Groucho related gene 5 (GRG5) have a role only in late development?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n\nThe passage states that GRG5 is involved in early developmental stages by analyzing its function in stem cell fate decisions.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genome is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs). Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Recent advances in our understanding of the three-dimensional organization of the eukaryotic nucleus have rendered the spatial distribution of genes increasingly relevant. In a recent work (Tsochatzidou et al., Nucleic Acids Res 45:5818-5828, 2017), we proposed the existence of a functional compartmentalization of the yeast genome according to which, genes occupying the chromosomal regions at the nuclear periphery have distinct structural, functional and evolutionary characteristics compared to their centromeric-proximal counterparts. Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing. \n Form and function of topologically associating genomic domains in budding yeast. \n Although similar structures appear to be conserved in fission yeast, computational modeling and analysis of high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data have been used to argue that the small, highly constrained budding yeast chromosomes could not have these structures. In contrast, herein we analyze Hi-C data for budding yeast and identify 200-kb scale TADs, whose boundaries are enriched for transcriptional activity. Furthermore, these boundaries separate regions of similarly timed replication origins connecting the long-known effect of genomic context on replication timing to genome architecture. To investigate the molecular basis of TAD formation, we performed Hi-C experiments on cells depleted for the Forkhead transcription factors, Fkh1 and Fkh2, previously associated with replication timing. Forkhead factors do not regulate TAD formation, but do promote longer-range genomic interactions and control interactions between origins near the centromere. Thus, our work defines spatial organization within the budding yeast nucleus, demonstrates the conserved role of genome architecture in regulating DNA replication, and identifies a molecular mechanism specifically regulating interactions between pericentric origins. \n Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing. \n Around the same time, it was also shown that the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is organized in topologically associated domains (TADs), which are largely associated with the replication timing.  \n In contrast, herein we analyze Hi-C data for budding yeast and identify 200-kb scale TADs, whose boundaries are enriched for transcriptional activity. \n Is the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genome organized into topologically associated domains (TADs)?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, the NLM medical text indexer (MTI) is still useful and relevant. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: 12 years on - Is the NLM medical text indexer still useful and relevant? \n Facing a growing workload and dwindling resources, the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) created the Indexing Initiative project in 1996. This cross-library team's mission is to explore indexing methodologies for ensuring quality and currency of NLM document collections. The NLM Medical Text Indexer (MTI) is the main product of this project and has been providing automated indexing recommendations since 2002. After all of this time, the questions arise whether MTI is still useful and relevant.METHODS: To answer the question about MTI usefulness, we track a wide variety of statistics related to how frequently MEDLINE indexers refer to MTI recommendations, how well MTI performs against human indexing, and how often MTI is used. To answer the question of MTI relevancy compared to other available tools, we have participated in the 2013 and 2014 BioASQ Challenges. The BioASQ Challenges have provided us with an unbiased comparison between the MTI system and other systems performing the same task.RESULTS: Indexers have continually increased their use of MTI recommendations over the years from 15.75% of the articles they index in 2002 to 62.44% in 2014 showing that the indexers find MTI to be increasingly useful. The MTI performance statistics show significant improvement in Precision (+0.2992) and F1 (+0.1997) with modest gains in Recall (+0.0454) over the years. MTI consistency is comparable to the available indexer consistency studies. MTI performed well in both of the BioASQ Challenges ranking within the top tier teams.CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded. The BioASQ Challenge results have shown that we need to incorporate more machine learning into MTI while still retaining the indexing rules that have earned MTI the indexers' trust over the years. We also need to expand MTI through the use of full text, when and where it is available, to provide coverage of indexing terms that are typically only found in the full text. The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant. \n The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant. \n CONCLUSIONS\nBased on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded. \n 12 years on - Is the NLM medical text indexer still useful and relevant?Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded.  \n The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant. \n After all of this time, the questions arise whether MTI is still useful and relevant.<br><b>METHODS</b>: To answer the question about MTI usefulness, we track a wide variety of statistics related to how frequently MEDLINE indexers refer to MTI recommendations, how well MTI performs against human indexing, and how often MTI is used. \n The MTI performance statistics show significant improvement in Precision (+0.2992) and F<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded. \n The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant.<br> \n After all of this time, the questions arise whether MTI is still useful and relevant. \n The role of MTI at NLM is also expanding into new areas, further reinforcing the idea that MTI is increasingly useful and relevant. \n Based on our findings, yes, MTI is still relevant and useful, and needs to be improved and expanded. \n Is the NLM medical text indexer (MTI) still useful and relevant?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nThe question is, \"Is the NLM medical text indexer (MTI) still useful and relevant?\" to answer this question, we need to investigate MTI's usefulness and relevance.

can serve as a predictive factor for the response to intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin in patients with nonmuscle invasive, high grade bladder cancer. \n Bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy has been found by a number of investigators to be effective in the treatment and prevention of superficial bladder cancer. \n Pancreatic and psoas abscesses as a late complication of intravesical administration of bacillus Calmette-Guerin for bladder cancer: a case report and review of the literature.This case illustrates the fact that although intravesical administration of bacillus

steroid treated and immunocompromised patients.Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin is a viable therapeutic option in patients with high risk superficial bladder cancer and concomitant lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, treatment with low dose oral steroids or treatment with inhaled steroids.  \n Our results suggest that intralesional bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy can afford long term protection from transplanted bladder cancer, and that live bacillus Calmette-Guerin is superior to levamisole and P3 + Re-glycolipid + bacillus Calmette-Guerin cell walls in the treatment of

MoRFs facilitate translation, transport, signaling, and regulatory processes and are found across all domains of life. A popular computational tool, MoRFpred, accurately predicts MoRFs in protein sequences. MoRFpred is implemented as a user-friendly web server that is freely available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/MoRFpred/ . We describe this predictor, explain how to run the web server, and show how to interpret the results it generates. We also demonstrate the utility of this web server based on two case studies, focusing on the relevance of evolutionary conservation of MoRF regions. \n MoRFPred-plus: Computational Identification of MoRFs in Protein Sequences using Physicochemical Properties and HMM profiles. \n Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) lack stable tertiary structure and they actively participate in performing various biological functions. These IDPs expose short binding regions called Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) that permit interaction with structured protein regions. Upon interaction they undergo a disorder-to-order transition as a result of which their functionality arises. Predicting these MoRFs in disordered protein sequences is a challenging task.METHOD: In this study, we present MoRFpred-plus, an improved predictor over our previous proposed predictor to identify MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. Two separate independent propensity scores are computed via incorporating physicochemical properties and HMM profiles, these scores are combined to predict final MoRF propensity score for a given residue. The first score reflects the characteristics of a query residue to be part of MoRF region based on the composition and similarity of assumed MoRF and flank regions. The second score reflects the characteristics of a query residue to be part of MoRF region based on the properties of flanks associated around the given residue in the query protein sequence. The propensity scores are processed and common averaging is applied to generate the final prediction score of MoRFpred-plus.RESULTS: Performance of the proposed predictor is compared with available MoRF predictors, MoRFchibi, MoRFpred, and ANCHOR. Using previously collected training and test sets used to evaluate the mentioned predictors, the proposed predictor outperforms these predictors and generates lower false positive rate. In addition, MoRFpred-plus is a downloadable predictor, which makes it useful as it can be used as input to other computational tools. \n OPAL: prediction of MoRF regions in intrinsically disordered protein sequences. \n Intrinsically disordered proteins lack stable 3-dimensional structure and play a crucial role in performing various biological functions. Key to their biological function are the molecular recognition features (MoRFs) located within long disordered regions. Computationally identifying these MoRFs from disordered protein sequences is a challenging task. In this study, we present a new MoRF predictor, OPAL, to identify MoRFs in disordered protein sequences. OPAL utilizes two independent sources of information computed using different component predictors. The scores are processed and combined using common averaging method. The first score is computed using a component MoRF predictor which utilizes composition and sequence similarity of MoRF and non-MoRF regions to detect MoRFs. The second score is calculated using half-sphere exposure (HSE), solvent accessible surface area (ASA) and backbone angle information of the disordered protein sequence, using information from the amino acid properties of flanks surrounding the MoRFs to distinguish MoRF and non-MoRF residues.Results: OPAL is evaluated using test sets that were previously used to evaluate MoRF predictors, MoRFpred, MoRFchibi and MoRFchibi-web. The results demonstrate that OPAL outperforms all the available MoRF predictors and is the most accurate predictor available for MoRF prediction. It is available at http://www.alok-ai-lab.com/tools/opal/. \n OPAL+: Length-Specific MoRF Prediction in Intrinsically Disordered Protein Sequences. \n Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) contain long unstructured regions, which play an important role in their function. These intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) participate in binding events through regions called molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Computational prediction of MoRFs helps identify the potentially functional regions in IDRs. In this study, OPAL+, a novel MoRF predictor, is presented. OPAL+ uses separate models to predict MoRFs of varying lengths along with incorporating the hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles and physicochemical properties of MoRFs and their flanking regions. Together, these features help OPAL+ achieve a marginal performance improvement of 0.4-0.7% over its predecessor for diverse MoRF test sets. This performance improvement comes at the expense of increased run time as a result of the requirement of HMM profiles. OPAL+ is available for download at https://github.com/roneshsharma/OPAL-plus/wiki/OPAL-plus-Download. \n Computational Identification of MoRFs in Protein Sequences Using Hierarchical Application of Bayes Rule. \n Key to their regulatory function is often the binding to globular protein domains via sequence elements known as molecular recognition features (MoRFs). Development of computational tools for the identification of candidate MoRF locations in amino acid sequences is an important task and an area of growing interest. Given the relative sparseness of MoRFs in protein sequences, the accuracy of the available MoRF predictors is often inadequate for practical usage, which leaves a significant need and room for improvement. In this work, we introduce MoRFCHiBi_Web, which predicts MoRF locations in protein sequences with higher accuracy compared to current MoRF predictors.METHODS: Three distinct and largely independent property scores are computed with component predictors and then combined to generate the final MoRF propensity scores. The first score reflects the likelihood of sequence windows to harbour MoRFs and is based on amino acid composition and sequence similarity information. It is generated by MoRFCHiBi using small windows of up to 40 residues in size. The second score identifies long stretches of protein disorder and is generated by ESpritz with the DisProt option. Lastly, the third score reflects residue conservation and is assembled from PSSM files generated by PSI-BLAST. These propensity scores are processed and then hierarchically combined using Bayes rule to generate the final MoRFCHiBi_Web predictions.RESULTS: MoRFCHiBi_Web was tested on three datasets. Results show that MoRFCHiBi_Web outperforms previously developed predictors by generating less than half the false positive rate for the same true positive rate at practical threshold values. \n Computational identification of MoRFs in protein sequences. \n In this study, we introduce MoRFCHiBi, a new computational approach for fast and accurate prediction of MoRFs in protein sequences. MoRFCHiBi combines the outcomes of two support vector machine (SVM) models that take advantage of two different kernels with high noise tolerance. The first, SVMS, is designed to extract maximal information from the general contrast in amino acid compositions between MoRFs, their surrounding regions (Flanks), and the remainders of the sequences. The second, SVMT, is used to identify similarities between regions in a query sequence and MoRFs of the training set.RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of our predictor by comparing its results with those of two currently available MoRF predictors, MoRFpred and ANCHOR. Using three test sets that have previously been collected and used to evaluate MoRFpred and ANCHOR, we demonstrate that MoRFCHiBi outperforms the other predictors with respect to different evaluation metrics. In addition, MoRFCHiBi is downloadable and fast, which makes it useful as a component in other computational prediction tools.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/morf/. \n OPAL: prediction of MoRF regions in intrinsically disordered protein sequences.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \n Computational prediction of MoRFs helps identify the potentially functional regions in IDRs. \n Can you computationally predict Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) regions in Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs)?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nMoRFs are segments of intrinsically disordered regions that bind to partner proteins, where binding is concomitant with a transition to a structured conformation.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Human copy number variants are enriched in regions of low mappability. \n Applying PopSV to 640 human genomes, we find that low-mappability regions are approximately 5\u00a0times more likely to harbor germline CNVs, in stark contrast to the nearly uniform distribution observed for somatic CNVs in 95 cancer genomes.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Adar3 Is Involved in Learning and Memory in Mice. \n  The newest member of the A-I editing family of ADAR proteins, the vertebrate-specific ADAR3, is highly expressed in the brain, but its functional significance is unknown. In vitro studies have suggested that ADAR3 acts as a negative regulator of A-I RNA editing but the scope and underlying mechanisms are also unknown. Meta-analysis of published data indicates that mouse Adar3 expression is highest in the hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, and olfactory region. Consistent with this, we show that mice lacking exon 3 of Adar3 (which encodes two double stranded RNA binding domains) have increased levels of anxiety and deficits in hippocampus-dependent short- and long-term memory formation. RNA sequencing revealed a dysregulation of genes involved in synaptic function in the hippocampi of Adar3-deficient mice. We also show that ADAR3 transiently translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon KCl-mediated activation in SH-SY5Y cells. These results indicate that ADAR3 contributes to cognitive processes in mammals. \n Adar3 Is Involved in Learning and Memory in Mice.-deficient mice.  \n Is Adar3 involved in learning and memory?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe passage states that Adar3 is highly expressed in the brain, and in vitro studies suggest that it acts as a negative regulator of A-I RNA editing.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Allele Phasing Greatly Improves the Phylogenetic Utility of Ultraconserved Elements. \n Our empirical analyses of Ultraconserved Element (UCE) locus data collected from the South American hummingbird genus Topaza demonstrate that phased allele sequences carry sufficient phylogenetic information to infer the genetic structure, lineage divergence, and biogeographic history of a genus that diversified during the last three million years. The phylogenetic results support the recognition of two species, and suggest a high rate of gene flow across large distances of rainforest habitats but rare admixture across the Amazon River.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, mitochondria can be inherited by both parents. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Biparental Inheritance of Mitochondrial DNA in Humans. \n Although there has been considerable debate about whether paternal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transmission may coexist with maternal transmission of mtDNA, it is generally believed that mitochondria and mtDNA are exclusively maternally inherited in humans. Here, we identified three unrelated multigeneration families with a high level of mtDNA heteroplasmy (ranging from 24 to 76%) in a total of 17 individuals. Heteroplasmy of mtDNA was independently examined by high-depth whole mtDNA sequencing analysis in our research laboratory and in two Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathologists-accredited laboratories using multiple approaches. A comprehensive exploration of mtDNA segregation in these families shows biparental mtDNA transmission with an autosomal dominantlike inheritance mode. Our results suggest that, although the central dogma of maternal inheritance of mtDNA remains valid, there are some exceptional cases where paternal mtDNA could be passed to the offspring.  \n Can mitochondria be inherited by both parents in humans?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nMitochondria are inherited by the egg cell. However, in these families, they found a high level of mtDNA heteroplasmy (24-76%) in 17 individuals. This means that the mtDNA is not only inherited from the mother but also from the father. This is known as biparental mtDNA transmission with an autosomal dominant-like inheritance mode.\nTherefore, option (a)",

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Deletion at 6q24.2-26 predicts longer survival of high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer patients. \n We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). The prognostic value of this deletion was validated in two independent series, one consisting of 36 HGSOCs analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (P = 0.04) and another comprised of 411 HGSOCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA) (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.48-0.93, Padj = 0.019).

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: BCL11B mutations in patients affected by a neurodevelopmental disorder with reduced type 2 innate lymphoid cells. \n Using massively parallel sequencing we identified 13 patients bearing heterozygous germline alterations in BCL11B. Notably, all of them are affected by global developmental delay with speech impairment and intellectual disability; however, none displayed overt clinical signs of immune deficiency. Six frameshift mutations, two nonsense mutations, one missense mutation, and two chromosomal rearrangements resulting in diminished BCL11B expression, arose de novo. A further frameshift mutation was transmitted from a similarly affected mother. Interestingly, the most severely affected patient harbours a missense mutation within a zinc-finger domain of BCL11B, probably affecting the DNA-binding structural interface, similar to the recently published patient. Furthermore, the most C-terminally located premature termination codon mutation fails to rescue the progenitor cell proliferation defect in hippocampal slice cultures from Bcl11b-deficient mice. Concerning the role of BCL11B in the immune system, extensive immune phenotyping of our patients revealed alterations in the T cell compartment and lack of peripheral type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), consistent with the findings described in Bcl11b-deficient mice. Unsupervised analysis of 102 T lymphocyte subpopulations showed that the patients clearly cluster apart from healthy children, further supporting the common aetiology of the disorder. Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. In addition, we suggest that missense mutations affecting specific sites within zinc-finger domains might result in distinct and more severe clinical outcomes. \n Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay.  \n Taken together, we show here that mutations leading either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay. \n Is there a link between BCL11B haploinsufficiency and syndromic neurodevelopmental delay?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe question is asking whether there is a link between BCL11B haploinsufficiency and syndromic neurodevelopmental delay.\nThe passage explains that BCL11B mutations lead either to BCL11B haploinsufficiency or to a truncated BCL11B protein, which clinically cause a non-syndromic neurodevelopmental delay.\nHowever, the passage does not provide any evidence",

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, there is some evidence that pets also alter the gut microbial composition of infants. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Since there is some evidence that pets also alter the gut microbial composition of infants, changes to the gut microbiome are putative pathways by which pet exposure can reduce these risks to health. \n The impact of pet ownership varies under different birth scenarios; however, in common, exposure to pets increased the abundance of two bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, which have been negatively associated with childhood atopy and obesity. \n As a common effect in all birth scenarios, pre- and postnatal pet exposure enriched the abundance of Oscillospira and/or Ruminococcus (P\u2009<\u20090.05) with more than a twofold greater likelihood of high abundance. Among vaginally born infants with maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis exposure, Streptococcaceae were substantially and significantly reduced by pet exposure (P\u2009<\u20090.001, FDRp\u2009=\u20090.03), reflecting an 80% decreased likelihood of high abundance (OR 0.20, 95%CI, 0.06-0.70) for pet exposure during pregnancy alone and a 69% reduced likelihood (OR 0.31, 95%CI, 0.16-0.58) for exposure in the pre- and postnatal time periods. \n Exposure to household furry pets influences the gut microbiota of infant at 3-4\u00a0months following various birth scenarios. \n Can pets affect infant microbiomed?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..

Yes, whole-genome duplicates tend to exhibit less profound phenotypic effects when deleted, are functionally less divergent, and are associated with a different set of functions than their small-scale duplicate counterparts. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ:  Also, we observe that transporter and glycolytic genes have a higher probability to be retained in duplicate after WGD and subsequent gene loss, both in the model as in S. cerevisiae, which leads to an increase in glycolytic flux after WGD \n We show that the retention of genes in duplicate in the model, corresponds nicely with those retained in duplicate after the ancestral WGD in S. cerevisiae \n Thus, our model confirms the hypothesis that WGD has been important in the adaptation of yeast to the new, glucose-rich environment that arose after the appearance of angiosperms. \n Whole-genome duplicates tend to exhibit less profound phenotypic effects when deleted, are functionally less divergent, and are associated with a different set of functions than their small-scale duplicate counterparts. \n The results uncover the WGD as a major source for the evolution of a complex interconnected block of transcriptional pathways. \n These selected pairs, both WGD and SSD, tend to have decelerated functional evolution, have higher propensities of co-clustering into the same protein complexes, and share common interacting partners. \n Moreover, we find additional transcriptional profiles that are suggestive of neo- and subfunctionalization of duplicate gene copies. These patterns are strongly correlated with the functional dependencies and sequence divergence profiles of gene copies. \n Functional and transcriptional divergence between the copies after gene duplication has been considered the main driver of innovations . \n Whole-genome duplicates tend to exhibit less profound phenotypic effects when deleted, are functionally less divergent, and are associated with a different set of functions than their small-scale duplicate counterparts. \n Empirical data shows that whole-genome duplications (WGDs) are more likely to be retained than small-scale duplications (SSDs), though their relative contribution to the functional fate of duplicates remains unexplored. \n Are whole-genome duplications more divergent than small-scale duplications in yeast?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nAccording to the passage, the model predicts that WGDs are more likely to retain duplicates than SSDs.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are major DNA lesions that are constantly formed during physiological processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and recombination, or as a result of exogenous agents such as ionizing radiation, radiomimetic drugs, and genome editing nucleases \n Whereas most endogenous and exogenous DNA damaging agents typically generate lesions that are relatively isolated and can be repaired easily, ionizing radiation (IR) also induces clustered lesions causing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) \n The induction of DNA interstrand cross-links by ionizing radiation has been largely ignored in favour of studies on double-strand break formation and repair. \n While much is known about radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their repair,  \n Exposure of cells to ionizing radiation induces DNA double-strand breaks. \n DNA double-strand breaks are considered to be the most deleterious lesion induced by ionizing radiation. \n Influence of chromatin structure on the induction of DNA double strand breaks by ionizing radiation. \n Ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs such as bleomycin, calichieamycin, neocarzinostatin chromophore, and other synthetic agents can produce both single and double strand breaks in DNA. \n RESULTS BRCA2-defective cells were unable to repair the double-strand DNA breaks induced by ionizing radiation. \n BACKGROUND Induction of DNA double strand breaks and alterations in the repair of these breaks is implicated in breast carcinogenesis. \n Double-stranded breaks ( DSBs ) are the most injurious type of DNA damage , being induced by ionizing radiation ( IR ) and cytotoxic agents used in cancer treatment \n Double-stranded breaks ( DSBs ) are cytotoxic DNA lesions caused by oxygen radicals , ionizing radiation , and radiomimetic chemicals \n Gamma-ray irradiation introduces single and/or double strand breaks into the DNA molecule of the cells. \n Are breaks in double stranded DNA associated with ionizing radiation?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n\nOption (a) states that breaks in double-stranded DNA are associated with ionizing radiation. This is because ionizing radiation can induce DNA double-strand breaks, which are considered the most deleterious lesion induced by ionizing radiation. The passage highlights this fact by stating that exposure to ionizing radiation induces DNA double-strand breaks. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.",

Yes, KAT2A inhibition demonstrated anti-AML activity by inducing myeloid differentiation and apoptosis, and suppressed the growth of primary human AMLs of diverse genotypes while sparing normal hemopoietic stem-progenitor cells. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis, for which mainstream treatments have not changed for decades. To identify additional therapeutic targets in AML, we optimize a genome-wide clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) screening platform and use it to identify genetic vulnerabilities in AML cells.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, promoter shape varies across populations and affects promoter evolution and expression noise. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Promoter shape varies across populations and affects promoter evolution and expression noise. \n Animal promoters initiate transcription either at precise positions (narrow promoters) or dispersed regions (broad promoters), a distinction referred to as promoter shape. Although highly conserved, the functional properties of promoters with different shapes and the genetic basis of their evolution remain unclear. Here we used natural genetic variation across a panel of 81 Drosophila lines to measure changes in transcriptional start site (TSS) usage, identifying thousands of genetic variants affecting transcript levels (strength) or the distribution of TSSs within a promoter (shape). Our results identify promoter shape as a molecular trait that can evolve independently of promoter strength. Broad promoters typically harbor shape-associated variants, with signatures of adaptive selection. Single-cell measurements demonstrate that variants modulating promoter shape often increase expression noise, whereas heteroallelic interactions with other promoter variants alleviate these effects. These results uncover new functional properties of natural promoters and suggest the minimization of expression noise as an important factor in promoter evolution. \n Promoter shape varies across populations and affects promoter evolution and expression noise \n Does promoter shape vary across populations?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe question is asking whether promoter shape varies across populations.\nThe passage states that \"Animal promoters initiate transcription either at precise positions (narrow promoters) or dispersed regions (broad promoters), a distinction referred to as promoter shape.\" This implies that promoter shape is a characteristic of promoters across different populations.\nTherefore, the answer is (a) yes.",

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, AND-1 fork protection function prevents fork resection and is essential for proliferation. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: AND-1 fork protection function prevents fork resection and is essential for proliferation. \n AND-1/Ctf4 bridges the CMG helicase and DNA polymerase alpha, facilitating replication. Using an inducible degron system in avian cells, we find that AND-1 depletion is incompatible with proliferation, owing to cells accumulating in G2 with activated DNA damage checkpoint. Replication without AND-1 causes fork speed slow-down and accumulation of long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps at the replication fork junction, with these regions being converted to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in G2. Strikingly, resected forks and DNA damage accumulation in G2, but not fork slow-down, are reverted by treatment with mirin, an MRE11 nuclease inhibitor. Domain analysis of AND-1 further revealed that the HMG box is important for fast replication but not for proliferation, whereas conversely, the WD40 domain prevents fork resection and subsequent DSB-associated lethality. Thus, our findings uncover a fork protection function of AND-1/Ctf4 manifested via the WD40 domain that is essential for proliferation and averts genome instability. \n Thus , our findings uncover a fork protection function of AND-1/Ctf4 manifested via the WD40 domain that is essential for proliferation and averts genome instability \n Thus, our findings uncover a fork protection function of AND-1/Ctf4 manifested via the WD40 domain that is essential for proliferation and averts genome instability. \n Is AND-1/Ctf4 essential for proliferation?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n\nThe passage states that AND-1/Ctf4 has a fork protection function that prevents fork resection and is essential for proliferation.

Cell proliferation was tested by [H3] DNA incorporation assay. Cell apoptosis was tested by caspase-3/-9 activity assay, Histone DNA ELISA assay, Annexin V FACS assay and TUNEL staining assay. Cell cycle progression was tested by propidium iodide (PI) FACS assay. Signaling was tested by Western blotting assay. The nude mice PC-3 xenograft model was applied to test AZD5153's activity in vivo.RESULTS: AZD5153 inhibited proliferation and survival of established and primary prostate cancer cells.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: The Mcm2-Ctf4-Pol\u03b1 Axis Facilitates Parental Histone H3-H4 Transfer to Lagging Strands. \n Although essential for epigenetic inheritance, the transfer of parental histone (H3-H4)2 tetramers that contain epigenetic modifications to replicating DNA strands is poorly understood. Here, we show that the Mcm2-Ctf4-Pol\u03b1 axis facilitates the transfer of parental (H3-H4)2 tetramers to lagging-strand DNA at replication forks. Mutating the conserved histone-binding domain of the Mcm2 subunit of the CMG (Cdc45-MCM-GINS) DNA helicase, which translocates along the leading-strand template, results in a marked enrichment of parental (H3-H4)2 on leading strand, due to the impairment of the transfer of parental (H3-H4)2 to lagging strands. Similar effects are observed in Ctf4 and Pol\u03b1 primase mutants that disrupt the connection of the CMG helicase to Pol\u03b1 that resides on lagging-strand template.

They included calcium channel antagonists, NMDA receptor antagonists, lubeluzole, CDP-choline, the free radical scavenger tirilazad and ebselen, enlimomab, GABA agonist clomethiazole, the sodium channel antagonist fosphenytoin, magnesium, glycine site antagonist GV150526 and piracetam.  \n CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to show an efficacy of lubeluzole in the treatment of acute stroke.  \n Overall, of all treated patients, 401 (22.5%) died: 203 (22.5%) in the lubeluzole group and 198 (22.4%) with placebo. Of all subjects treated, 853 (95%) on lubeluzole and 826 (93%) on placebo reported an adverse event during their treatment period or within the next 2 days after discontinuation of treatment. \n CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with lubeluzole within 6 hours of the onset of ischemic stroke had a nonsignificant effect on mortality and resulted in improved clinical outcome compared with placebo, with no safety concerns. \n RESULTS: The overall mortality rate at 12 weeks for lubeluzole-treated patients was 20.7% compared to 25.2% for placebo-treated patients (NS). Controlling for relevant covariates, the degree of neurological recovery (NIHSS) at week 12 significantly favored lubeluzole over placebo (P = .033). Lubeluzole treatment similarly resulted in significantly greater improvements in functional status (Barthel Index) (P = .038) and overall disability (Rankin Scale) (P = .034) after 12 weeks. A global test statistic confirmed that lubeluzole-treated patients had a more favorable clinical outcome at 12 weeks (P = .041). \n CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute ischemic stroke, the dosage regimen of 7.5 mg over 1 hour followed by 10 mg/d of intravenous lubeluzole is safe and statistically significantly reduced mortality.  \n CONCLUSIONS\n\nTreatment with lubeluzole within 6 hours of the onset of ischemic stroke had a nonsignificant effect on mortality and resulted in improved clinical outcome compared with placebo, with no safety concerns. \n CONCLUSIONS: Lubeluzole, given in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke, is not associated with a significant reduction of death or dependency at the end of scheduled follow-up period but seems to be associated with a significant increase of heart-conduction disorders (Q-T prolonged >450 msec). \n Treatment with lubeluzole within 6 hours of the onset of ischemic stroke had a nonsignificant effect on mortality and resulted in improved clinical outcome compared with placebo, with no safety concerns. \n In the overall study population, treatment with intravenous lubeluzole within 6 h of the onset of ischaemic stroke did not affect mortality or clinical outcome. \n Should Lubeluzole be used for treatment of ischemic stroke?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe article states that lubeluzole showed promising neuroprotective effects in animal stroke models but failed to show benefits in acute ischemic stroke in humans.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: TET proteins regulate the lineage specification and TCR-mediated expansion of iNKT cells. \n We found that simultaneous deletion of Tet2 and Tet3 in mouse CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes resulted in dysregulated development and proliferation of invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells). Tet2-Tet3 double-knockout (DKO) iNKT cells displayed pronounced skewing toward the NKT17 lineage, with increased DNA methylation and impaired expression of genes encoding the key lineage-specifying factors T-bet and ThPOK. Transfer of purified Tet2-Tet3 DKO iNKT cells into immunocompetent recipient mice resulted in an uncontrolled expansion that was dependent on the nonclassical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein CD1d, which presents lipid antigens to iNKT cells. Our data indicate that TET proteins regulate iNKT cell fate by ensuring their proper development and maturation and by suppressing aberrant proliferation mediated by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR). \n TET proteins regulate the lineage specification and TCR-mediated expansion of iNKT cells . \n Is there a role for TET proteins in invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) cell fate?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nTET proteins regulate the lineage specification and TCR-mediated expansion of iNKT cells. \nIn this passage, the author states that TET proteins regulate the lineage specification and TCR-mediated expansion of iNKT cells.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Antitumor activity of saracatinib (AZD0530), a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer. \n We evaluated the antitumor effect of a c-Src/Abl kinase inhibitor, saracatinib (AZD0530), alone or combined with chemotherapeutic agents in gastric cancer cell lines and a NCI-N87 xenograft model. Among 10 gastric cancer cell lines, saracatinib specifically inhibited the growth and migration/invasion of SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells. Saracatinib blocked the Src/FAK, HER family, and oncogenic signaling pathways, and it induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis in SNU216 and NCI-N87 cells.  \n Consistent with our in vitro findings, cotreatment with saracatinib and 5-FU resulted in enhanced antitumor activity in the NCI-N87 xenografts.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: External Beam Radiotherapy Increases the Risk of Bladder Cancer When Compared with Radical Prostatectomy in Patients Affected by Prostate Cancer: A Population-based Analysis. \n On multivariable competing risk regression analyses, treatment with EBRT was independently associated with the risk of developing a second primary BCa (hazard ratio: 1.35, CI: 1.18-1.55; p<0.001), but not RCa (p=0.4).  \n CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with EBRT are at increased risk of developing a second primary BCa compared with those treated with RP. However, no differences were found considering RCa incidence in patients treated with RP or EBRT within the first 5 yr after primary therapy.  \n We found that those treated with external beam radiotherapy are at an increased risk of developing a second primary bladder cancer tumor. \n All radiation modalities were found to have an increased RR of developing BlCa after 10\u00a0years, with brachytherapy having a significantly higher RR than external beam radiation (EBRT) or combined EBRT and brachytherapy in Caucasian men and a significantly higher RR than EBRT in men of other/unknown ethnicity.  \n CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of BlCa after prostate radiation occurs predominantly after 10\u00a0years, regardless of ethnicity. The RR of developing BlCa after 10\u00a0years is significantly higher following brachytherapy than after EBRT or EBRT and brachytherapy.  \n Based on the data in the literature, there is a\u00a0consistently increased risk of bladder cancer (HR: 1.67, 95% CI 1.55-1.80), rectal cancer (HR: 1.79, 95% CI 1.34-2.38), and colorectal cancer (HR: 1.79, 95% CI 1.34-23.8) following percutaneous radiation therapy. Following brachytherapy only an increased for the development of bladder cancer (HR: 2.14, 95% CI 1.03-3.94) has been observed. \n When comparing with a matched general French population, the standard incidence ratio (SIR) for bladder cancer was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.46-1.93). \n LDR resulted in lower bladder cancer risks than HDR, and lower or similar risks of rectal cancer. \n Compared to external beam techniques, second rectal and bladder cancer risks were lowest for brachytherapy. \n OBJECTIVE: Although it is well known that radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer, the effect of aging and smoking with radiotherapy on incidence rate of secondary bladder cancer remains unknown.  \n RESULTS: During the median follow-up period of 4.3 and 3.1 years, secondary bladder cancer occurred in 11 (3.4%) and 5 (1.1%) of patients with prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy, respectively.  \n CONCLUSIONS\n\nMen who receive radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer have an increased risk of bladder cancer compared to patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and compared to the general population. \n Radiation therapy for prostate cancer increases subsequent risk of bladder and rectal cancer: a population based cohort study. \n RESULTS\n\nThe relative risk of bladder cancer developing after external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy compared to radical prostatectomy was 1.88, 1.52 and 1.85, respectively. \n Compared to the general United States population the standardized incidence ratio for bladder cancer developing after radical prostatectomy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy-brachytherapy was 0.99, 1.42, 1.10 and 1.39, respectively. \n OBJECTIVE\n\nAlthough it is well known that radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases comorbid rate of secondary bladder cancer, the effect of aging and smoking with

    "No, genes with monoallelic expression contribute disproportionately to genetic diversity in humans. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Genes with monoallelic expression contribute disproportionately to genetic diversity in humans. \n An unexpectedly large number of human autosomal genes are subject to monoallelic expression (MAE). Our analysis of 4,227 such genes uncovers surprisingly high genetic variation across human populations. This increased diversity is unlikely to reflect relaxed purifying selection. Remarkably, MAE genes exhibit an elevated recombination rate and an increased density of hypermutable sequence contexts. However, these factors do not fully account for the increased diversity. We find that the elevated nucleotide diversity of MAE genes is also associated with greater allelic age: variants in these genes tend to be older and are enriched in polymorphisms shared by Neanderthals and chimpanzees. Both synonymous and nonsynonymous alleles of MAE genes have elevated average population frequencies. We also observed strong enrichment of the MAE signature among genes reported to evolve under balancing selection. We propose that an important biological function of widespread MAE might be the generation of cell-to-cell heterogeneity; the increased genetic variation contributes to this heterogeneity. \n Genes with monoallelic expression contribute disproportionately to genetic diversity in humans \n Do genes with monoallelic expression contribute proportionally to genetic diversity in humans?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nAccording to the passage, \"Genes with monoallelic expression contribute disproportionately to genetic diversity in humans.\" This means that genes with monoallelic expression (MAE) contribute more to genetic diversity than their proportion in the genome.\nHowever, the passage also states that \"An unexpectedly large number of human autosomal genes are subject to monoallelic expression (MAE).\" This suggests that MAE",

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Deletion at 6q24.2-26 predicts longer survival of high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer patients. \n Standard treatments for advanced high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs) show significant side-effects and provide only short-term survival benefits due to disease recurrence. Thus, identification of novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers is urgently needed. We have used 42 paraffin-embedded HGSOCs, to evaluate the utility of DNA copy number alterations, as potential predictors of clinical outcome. Copy number-based unsupervised clustering stratified HGSOCs into two clusters of different immunohistopathological features and survival outcome (HR = 0.15, 95%CI = 0.03-0.81; Padj = 0.03). We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). The prognostic value of this deletion was validated in two independent series, one consisting of 36 HGSOCs analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (P = 0.04) and another comprised of 411 HGSOCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA) (HR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.48-0.93, Padj = 0.019). In addition, we confirmed the association of low expression of the genes from the region with longer survival in 799 HGSOCs (HR = 0.74, 95%CI = 0.61-0.90, log-rank P = 0.002) and 675 high-FIGO stage HGSOCs (HR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.61-0.96, log-rank P = 0.02) available from the online tool KM-plotter. Finally, by integrating copy number, RNAseq and survival data of 296 HGSOCs from TCGA we propose a few candidate genes that can potentially explain the association. Altogether our findings indicate that the 6q24.2-26 deletion is an independent marker of favorable outcome in HGSOCs with potential clinical value as it can be analyzed by FISH on tumor sections and guide the selection of patients towards more conservative therapeutic strategies in order to reduce side-effects and improve quality of life. \n We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). \n OBJECTIVE\n\nWe aimed to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of the nucleotide excision repair-related gene GTF2H5, which is localized at the 6q24.2-26 deletion previously reported by our group to predict longer survival of high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients. \n We found that loss at 6q24.2-26 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR = 0.06, 95%CI = 0.01-0.43, Padj = 0.005). \n OBJECTIVE\nWe aimed to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of the nucleotide excision repair-related gene GTF2H5, which is localized at the 6q24.2-26 deletion previously reported by our group to predict longer survival of high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients. \n OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of the nucleotide excision repair-related gene GTF2H5, which is localized at the 6q24.2-26 deletion previously reported by our group to predict longer survival of high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients. \n We aimed to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of the nucleotide excision repair-related gene GTF2H5, which is localized at the 6q24.2-26 deletion previously reported by our group to predict longer survival of high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients. \n Is deletion at 6q24.2-26 associated with shorter survival for ovarian cancer patients?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Clones in which the transgene was down-regulated by dexamethasone survived and were designated AtT-20/NET (for negative enhancer trap). \n The E1a gene of adenovirus encodes two proteins, 289 and 243 amino acids long, which have positive (transactivator) and negative (enhancer repressor) RNA polymerase II transcriptional regulatory properties and cell transformation activities including cooperation with an activated ras gene. \n Tandemly reiterated negative enhancer-like elements regulate transcription of a human gene for the large subunit of calcium-dependent protease. \n Upstream of the promoter region are tandemly reiterated multiple regulatory regions (-2.5k to -690, -690 to -460, -460 to -260, and -260 to -202), each of which negatively regulates the CANP mL gene promoter as well as heterologous promoters in an orientation-independent manner. \n The presence of a cellular factor(s) mediating the action of these positive (promoter) and negative regulatory elements was suggested by an in vivo competition assay. \n We have previously identified a silencer (negative enhancer) in glutathione transferase P (GST-P) gene which is strongly and specifically induced during hepatocarcinogenesis of the rat.  \n The possibility that SF-B/LAP/IL6-DBP functions as a dual positive and negative regulator is discussed. \n Coordinate regulation of Drosophila tropomyosin gene expression is controlled by multiple muscle-type-specific positive and negative enhancer elements \n Together these enhancer regions contain multiple muscle-type-specific positive and negative cis-acting elements which together contribute toward full expression of the gene. \n We also show that this somatic/visceral muscle element(s) can be repressed through an adjacent negative control region, suggesting that the regulation of expression in these muscles is under dual control during both phases of myogenesis. We propose a model in which transcriptional regulation of the Drosophila TmI gene is controlled by the cooperative interaction of multiple positive and negative cis-acting regulatory elements that control the temporal and muscle-type pattern of expression. \n Mutations targeted to the CArG-like motif abolished the suppressive effect of the negative enhancer and the inducibility of the promoter during myogenic differentiation.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, BNN-20 is involved in Parkinson's disease. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Neurotrophic factors are among the most promising treatments aiming at slowing or stopping and even reversing Parkinson's disease (PD). However, in most cases, they cannot readily cross the human blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Herein, we propose as a therapeutic for PD the small molecule 17-beta-spiro-[5-androsten-17,2'-oxiran]-3beta-ol (BNN-20), a synthetic analogue of DHEA, which crosses the BBB and is deprived of endocrine side-effects. Using the \"weaver\" mouse, a genetic model of PD, which exhibits progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the Substantia Nigra (SN), we have shown that long-term administration (P1-P21) of BNN-20 almost fully protected the dopaminergic neurons and their terminals, via i) a strong anti-apoptotic effect, probably mediated through the Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) neurotrophin receptor's PI3K-Akt-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, ii) by exerting an efficient antioxidant effect, iii) by inducing significant anti-inflammatory activity and iv) by restoring Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels. By intercrossing \"weaver\" with NGL mice (dual GFP/luciferase-NF-\u03ba\u0392 reporter mice, NF-\u03ba\u0392.GFP.Luc), we obtained Weaver/NGL mice that express the NF-\u03baB reporter in all somatic cells. Acute BNN-20 administration to Weaver/NGL mice induced a strong NF-\u03baB-dependent transcriptional response in the brain as detected by bioluminescence imaging, which was abolished by co-administration of the TrkB inhibitor ANA-12. This indicates that BNN-20 exerts its beneficial action (at least in part) through the TrkB-PI3K-Akt-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. These results could be of clinical relevance, as they suggest BNN-20 as an important neuroprotective agent acting through the TrkB neurotrophin receptor pathway, mimicking the action of the endogenous neurotrophin BDNF. Thus BNN-20 could be proposed for treatment of PD. \n Is BNN20 involved in Parkinson's disease?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n\nThe passage states that BNN-20 is a small molecule that crosses the blood-brain barrier and has shown to protect dopaminergic neurons in a genetic model of Parkinson's disease (PD).

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: MRPL53, a New Candidate Gene for Orofacial Clefting, Identified Using an eQTL Approach. \n A valuable approach to understand how individual and population genetic differences can predispose to disease is to assess the impact of genetic variants on cellular functions (e.g., gene expression) of cell and tissue types related to pathological states. To understand the genetic basis of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) susceptibility, a complex and highly prevalent congenital malformation, we searched for genetic variants with a regulatory role in a disease-related tissue, the lip muscle (orbicularis oris muscle [OOM]), of affected individuals. From 46 OOM samples, which are frequently discarded during routine corrective surgeries on patients with orofacial clefts, we derived mesenchymal stem cells and correlated the individual genetic variants with gene expression from these cultured cells. Through this strategy, we detected significant cis-eQTLs (i.e., DNA variants affecting gene expression) and selected a few candidates to conduct an association study in a large Brazilian cohort (624 patients and 668 controls). This resulted in the discovery of a novel susceptibility locus for NSCL/P, rs1063588, the best eQTL for the MRPL53 gene, where evidence for association was mostly driven by the Native American ancestry component of our Brazilian sample.

    "Let's think step by step. No, Uc.63+ promotes resistance to docetaxel through regulation of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Transcribed ultraconserved region Uc.63+ promotes resistance to docetaxel through regulation of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer. \n The transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a novel class of non-coding RNAs that are absolutely conserved across species and are involved in carcinogenesis including prostate cancer (PC). In this study, we investigated the transcriptional levels of 26 representative T-UCRs and determined the regions that were differentially expressed in PC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression of T-UCR Uc.63+ was increased in PC tissues. MTT assay and wound healing assay revealed that Uc.63+ was involved in cell growth and cell migration. miR-130b was predicted to have binding sites within the Uc.63+ sequence. The expression of miR-130b was significantly disturbed by the overexpression or knockdown of Uc.63+. We also showed that Uc.63+ regulated the expression of MMP2 via miR-130b regulation. Furthermore, overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation. In patients treated with docetaxel, the expression of serum Uc.63+ in the docetaxel-resistant patients was higher than that in the docetaxel-sensitive patients (P = 0.011). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the high expression of serum Uc.63+ correlated with a worse prognosis (P = 0.020). These results substantially support the important role that Uc.63+ plays in PC progression by interacting with miR-130b and indicate that Uc.63+ could potentially be a promising serum marker for deciding the best treatment for patients with CRPC. \n Transcribed ultraconserved region Uc.63+ promotes resistance to docetaxel through regulation of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer \n These results substantially support the important role that Uc.63+ plays in PC progression by interacting with miR-130b and indicate that Uc.63+ could potentially be a promising serum marker for deciding the best treatment for patients with CRPC \n Furthermore , overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation \n These results substantially support the important role that Uc.63+ plays in PC progression by interacting with miR-130b and indicate that Uc.63+ could potentially be a promising serum marker for deciding the best treatment for patients with CRPC. \n Furthermore, overexpression of Uc.63+ increased the expression of AR and its downstream molecule PSA and promoted resistance to docetaxel through AR regulation. \n These results substantially support the important role that Uc.63+ plays in PC progression by interacting with miR-130b and indicate that Uc.63+ could potentially be a promising serum marker for deciding the best treatment for patients with CRPC. \n Does Uc.63+ promote sensitivity to treatment in prostate cancer?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..

The neuroprotective effects of BNN27 have been recently reported. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of BNN27 on recognition memory in rats. For this purpose, the novel object task (NOT), a procedure assessing non-spatial recognition memory and the novel location task (NLT), a procedure evaluating spatial recognition memory were used. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of BNN27 (3 and 10mg/kg) antagonized delay-dependent deficits in the NOT in the normal rat, suggesting that this DHEA derivative affected acquisition, storage and retrieval of information. In addition, BNN27 (3 and 10mg/kg, i.p.) counteracted the scopolamine [0.2mg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.)]-induced non-spatial and spatial recognition memory deficits.

    "Let's think step by step. No, they strongly coincide with topological organisation, predicting the boundaries of hundreds of topologically associating domains (TADs) in human and Drosophila. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Topologically associating domains are ancient features that coincide with Metazoan clusters of extreme noncoding conservation. \n Clusters of CNEs define the span of regulatory inputs for many important developmental regulators and have been described previously as genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). Their function and distribution around important regulatory genes raises the question of how they relate to 3D conformation of these loci. Here, we show that clusters of CNEs strongly coincide with topological organisation, predicting the boundaries of hundreds of topologically associating domains (TADs) in human and Drosophila. The set of TADs that are associated with high levels of noncoding conservation exhibit distinct properties compared to TADs devoid of extreme noncoding conservation. The close correspondence between extreme noncoding conservation and TADs suggests that these TADs are ancient, revealing a regulatory architecture conserved over hundreds of millions of years.Metazoan genomes contain many clusters of conserved noncoding elements. Here, the authors provide evidence that these clusters coincide with distinct topologically associating domains in humans and Drosophila, revealing a conserved regulatory genomic architecture. \n Are genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) any different than TADs?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n\nTopologically associating domains (TADs) are defined as regions of the genome that are topologically associated with each other, meaning that they are organized in a specific 3D structure.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Emphasis is placed on meningiomas resulting from childhood treatment for primary brain tumor or tinea capitis, exposure to dental x-rays, and exposure to atomic explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  \n It is well known that radiation can induce meningiomas. These tumors usually arise in patients with a history of low-dose radiation to the scalp for treatment of tinea capitis or high-dose radiation for a previous brain tumor.  \n This paper describes six cases of radiation-associated intracranial meningiomas in patients previously treated with low-dose radiation to the scalp for tinea capitis. \n After a median follow-up of 40 years, an ERR/Gy of 4.63 and 1.98 (95% CI = 2.43-9.12 and 0.73-4.69) and an EAR/Gy per 10(4) PY of 0.48 and 0.31 (95% CI = 0.28-0.73 and 0.12-0.53) were observed for benign meningiomas and malignant brain tumors, respectively.  \n The estimated ERR/Gy for malignant brain tumors decreased with increasing age at irradiation from 3.56 to 0.47 (P = 0.037), while no trend with age was seen for benign meningiomas. The ERR for both types of tumor remains elevated at 30-plus years after exposure. \n Although meningiomas are known to be induced by low doses of cranial irradiation, such as those given to treat tinea capitis, little experience has been reported on the induction of meningiomas by high-dose cranial irradiation.  \n The exposed rats had a greater incidence of pituitary chromophobe adenomas, epithelial and mesothelial cell tumors than the unexposed controls but the excessive occurrence of malignant gliomas that was observed in the monkeys was absent in the rats.   \n We have analyzed 60 cases of intra-axial brain tumors associated with antecedent radiation therapy.

fremanezumab and galcanezumab) or the CGRP receptor (erenumab) effectively prevent migraine attacks.  \n Despite the clear safety concerns, clinical trial data suggests that their intermittent use remains a viable and safe alternative, with 2 molecules remaining in clinical development (ubrogepant and rimegepant).  \n Two gepants, ubrogepant and rimegepant, have completed positive pivotal

of migraine. \n Ubrogepant 100\u2009mg was significantly superior to placebo for two-hour pain freedom (25.5% vs 8.9%) but not for two-hour headache response. \n CONCLUSION: This trial supports ubrogepant's efficacy and provides further evidence that CGRP-RAs are viable options for the acute treatment of migraine. \n Meanwhile, 1 small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonist (ubrogepant, MK-1602) is currently in phase 3 studies for the acute treatment of migraine. \n CGRP receptor antagonists such as ubrogepant are effective for acute relief of migraine headache, whereas monoclonal antibodies

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, selinexor is effective for multiple myeloma. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Safety and efficacy of selinexor in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. \n Based on these findings, we conclude that selinexor in combination with dexamethasone is active in heavily pretreated MM and propose a RP2D of 45 mg/m2 (80 mg) plus 20 mg dexamethasone given twice weekly.  \n Selinexor, an Exportin-1 inhibitor, yielded promising results in quad- or penta-refractory MM including patients resistant to daratumumab.  \n Selective Inhibition of Nuclear Export With Oral Selinexor for Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma. \n Conclusion The combination of selinexor and dexamethasone has an ORR of 21% in patients with heavily pretreated, refractory myeloma with limited therapeutic options. \n Selinexor (KPT-330) is the first-in-human SINE compound. Early phase clinical trials have established the safety profile of this agent and have shown promising efficacy in combination with low-dose dexamethasone and other anti-MM agents. The combination of selinexor and dexamethasone has demonstrated activity in \"penta-refractory\" MM, (ie, MM refractory to the 5 most active anti-MM agents currently used in treatment). \n We found that DEX in combination with selinexor, an inhibitor of exportin-1 (XPO1) activity, synergistically inhibits the mTOR pathway and subsequently promotes cell death in MM cells.  \n The current findings are consistent with the beneficial therapeutic outcome in patients with MM when treated with the combination of selinexor and DEX.  \n Selinexor plus low-dose bortezomib and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. \n Selinexor is an oral inhibitor of the nuclear export protein exportin 1 (XPO1). Preclinical studies demonstrated synergistic antimyeloma activity between selinexor and proteasome inhibitors (PI) though suppression of NF\u03baB signaling and nuclear retention of tumor suppressor proteins. \n Targeting XPO1 with selinexor (the selective inhibitor of nuclear export; SINE compound KPT-330) demonstrates broad antitumor activity also in patient cells resistant to bortezomib; hence, it is a promising target in MM patients. Hypoxia is known to mediate tumor progression and drug resistance (including bortezomib resistance) in MM cells. \n Selinexor, used as a single agent, delayed tumor initiation and tumor progression, prolonging mice survival. In bortezomib-resistant xenografts, selinexor overcame drug resistance, significantly decreasing tumor burden and extending mice survival when combined with bortezomib. \n The responses seen with venetoclax in RRMM with t(11;14)(high BCL-2, low BCL-XL and MCL-1) and selinexor in penta-refractory myeloma which fulfills the FDA category of unmet need, opens up newer options for these patients.  \n The FDA granted accelerated approval to selinexor plus low-dose dexamethasone for triple-class refractory multiple myeloma , despite an advisory panel 's concerns about the drug 's toxicity and the lack of randomized clinical data . \n Selinexor ( in combination with dexamethasone ) received accelerated approval in the USA in July 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma ( RRMM) .  \n CONCLUSIONS\nSelinexor-dexamethasone resulted in objective treatment responses in patients with myeloma refractory to currently available therapies. \n Selinexor: A First-in-Class Nuclear Export Inhibitor for Management of Multiply Relapsed Multiple Myeloma. \n Objective: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of selinexor for management of relapsed multiple myeloma (MM). \n Selinexor (in combination with dexamethasone) received accelerated approval in the USA in July 2019 for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). \n Is Selinexor effective for multiple myeloma?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\n* The question is asking about the safety and efficacy of selinexor in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.\n* The answer is yes, as the text states that selinexor in combination with dexamethasone is active in heavily pretreated MM and proposes a RP2D of 45 mg/m2 (80 mg) plus 20 mg dexamethasone given",

Experience from a single clinical diagnostic center. \n Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with hereditary predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. Sensitive and accurate detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations is crucial for personalized clinical management of individuals affected by breast or ovarian cancer, and for the identification of at-risk healthy relatives. We performed molecular analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 898 Greek families, using Sanger sequencing or Next Generation Sequencing for the detection of small insertion/deletion frameshift, nonsynonymous, truncating and splice-site alterations and MLPA for the detection of large genomic rearrangements. In total, a pathogenic mutation was identified in 12.9% of 898 families analyzed. Of the 116 mutations identified in total 9% were novel and 14.7% were large genomic rearrangements. Our results indicate that different types of mutational events in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for the hereditary component of breast/ovarian cancer in the Greek population. Therefore the methodology used in the analysis of Greek patients must be able to detect both point and small frameshift mutations in addition to large genomic rearrangements across the entire coding region of the two genes. \n Is there a BRCA mutation analysis in the Greek population?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n\nThe passage states, \"Comprehensive BRCA mutation analysis in the Greek population.

Here we explore a new hypothesis: that there is no motor, and thermal motion within the nucleus drives extrusion. \n We observed that a single condensin complex is able to extrude tens of kilobase pairs of DNA at a force-dependent speed of up to 1500 base pairs per second, using the energy of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis \n Our model explains what can be the driving force of chromatin loop extrusion and how it can be ensured that loops grow quickly and in a good direction.

    "Let's think step by step. No, SLIC-CAGE is used for detection of transcription start sites. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Transcription Start Site Mapping Using Super-low Input Carrier-CAGE. \n SLIC-CAGE: high-resolution transcription start site mapping using nanogram-levels of total RNA. \n Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) is a methodology for genome-wide quantitative mapping of mRNA 5' ends to precisely capture transcription start sites at a single nucleotide resolution. In combination with high-throughput sequencing, CAGE has revolutionized our understanding of the rules of transcription initiation, led to discovery of new core promoter sequence features, and discovered transcription initiation at enhancers genome-wide. The biggest limitation of CAGE is that even the most recently improved version (nAnT-iCAGE) still requires large amounts of total cellular RNA (5 \u00b5g), preventing its application to scarce biological samples such as those from early embryonic development or rare cell types. Here, we present SLIC-CAGE, a Super-Low Input Carrier-CAGE approach to capture 5' ends of RNA polymerase II transcripts from as little as 5-10 ng of total RNA. This dramatic increase in sensitivity is achieved by specially designed, selectively degradable carrier RNA. We demonstrate the ability of SLIC-CAGE to generate data for genome-wide promoterome with 1000-fold less material than required by existing CAGE methods, by generating a complex, high-quality library from mouse embryonic day 11.5 primordial germ cells. \n Cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) is a method used for single-nucleotide resolution detection of RNA polymerase II transcription start sites (TSSs). Accurate detection of TSSs enhances identification and discovery of core promoters. In addition, active enhancers can be detected through signatures of bidirectional transcription initiation. Described here is a protocol for performing super-low input carrier-CAGE (SLIC-CAGE). This SLIC adaptation of the CAGE protocol minimizes RNA losses by artificially increasing the RNA amount through use of an in vitro transcribed RNA carrier mix that is added to the sample of interest, thus enabling library preparation from nanogram-amounts of total RNA (i.e., thousands of cells). The carrier mimics the expected DNA library fragment length distribution, thereby eliminating biases that could be caused by the abundance of a homogenous carrier. In the last stages of the protocol, the carrier is removed through degradation with homing endonucleases and the target library is amplified. The target sample library is protected from degradation, as the homing endonuclease recognition sites are long (between 18 and 27 bp), making the probability of their existence in the eukaryotic genomes very low. The end result is a DNA library ready for next-generation sequencing. All steps in the protocol, up to sequencing, can be completed within 6 days. The carrier preparation requires a full working day; however, it can be prepared in large quantities and kept frozen at -80 \u00b0C. Once sequenced, the reads can be processed to obtain genome-wide single-nucleotide resolution TSSs. TSSs can be used for core promoter or enhancer discovery, providing insight into gene regulation. Once aggregated to promoters, the data can also be used for 5'-centric expression profiling. \n Is SLIC-CAGE used for quantification of translation?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nSLIC-CAGE is a method for capturing 5' ends of RNA polymerase II transcripts.

Yes, Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is increased in DNPC relative to prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-expressing mCRPC in the Stand Up to Cancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation discovery cohort (11.2 v 0.28 reads per kilobase per million mapped reads; q  0.05; n = 117) and in the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center cohort (9.2 v 0.99 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads; P .0001). Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Dickkopf-1 Can Lead to Immune Evasion in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer. \n Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with low androgen receptor (AR) and without neuroendocrine signaling, termed double-negative prostate cancer (DNPC), is increasingly prevalent in patients treated with AR signaling inhibitors and is in need of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets.METHODS: Candidate genes enriched in DNPC were determined using differential gene expression analysis of discovery and validation cohorts of mCRPC biopsies. Laboratory studies were carried out in human mCRPC organoid cultures, prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, and mouse xenograft models. Epigenetic studies were carried out in a rapid autopsy cohort.RESULTS: Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) expression is increased in DNPC relative to prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-expressing mCRPC in the Stand Up to Cancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation discovery cohort (11.2 v 0.28 reads per kilobase per million mapped reads; q < 0.05; n = 117) and in the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center cohort (9.2 v 0.99 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads; P < .0001). DKK1 expression can be regulated by activated Wnt signaling in vitro and correlates with activating canonical Wnt signaling mutations and low PSA mRNA in mCRPC biopsies (P < .05). DKK1 hypomethylation was associated with increased DKK1 mRNA expression (Pearson r = -0.66; P < .0001) in a rapid autopsy cohort (n = 7). DKK1-high mCRPC biopsies are infiltrated with significantly higher numbers of quiescent natural killer (NK) cells (P < .005) and lower numbers of activated NK cells (P < .0005). Growth inhibition of the human PCa model PC3 by the anti-DKK1 monoclonal antibody DKN-01 depends on the presence of NK cells in a severe combined immunodeficient xenograft mouse model.CONCLUSION: These results support DKK1 as a contributor to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of DNPC. These data have provided the rationale for a clinical trial targeting DKK1 in mCRPC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03837353). \n DKK1 has been implicated in causing erosive arthritis, the osteolytic phenotypes of multiple myeloma and metastatic breast cancer, and osteoblastic metastases of prostate cancer. \n Dickkopf-1 protein secretion was documented in breast, prostate and lung cancer lines, but was negligible in melanoma. \n LTS: Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) expression is increased in DNPC relative to prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-expressing mCRPC in the Stand Up to Cancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation discovery cohort (11.2 v 0.28 reads per kilobase per million mapped reads; q < 0.05; n = 117) and in the University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center cohort (9.2 v 0.99 fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads; P < .0001).

In vivo, Bm \n Nanog is a newly identified transcriptional factor bearing a homeodomain and expressed in pluripotential cells of preimplantation and early postimplantation embryos, and embryonic stem (ES) and embryonic germ (EG) cells. \n Knockout experiments indicate that Nanog functions as a key player in maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells. \n Thus, in germ cell development, NANOG is expressed in proliferating germ cells, in which nuclear reprogramming is progressing. \n Nanog maintains pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells by inhibiting NFkappaB and cooperating with Stat3. \n We performed a genome-wide screen that combined full-length mESC transcriptome genomic mapping data with chromatin immunoprecipitation genomic location maps of the key mESC transcription factors Oct4 and Nanog. \n Nanog safeguards pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). \n Notably, the expression of Nanog, a key pluripotency regulator and repressor of extraembryonic endoderm specification in ES cells, was significantly reduced in Zic3 knockdown cells. \n Is Nanog repressed in pluripotent stem cells?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe passage states that Nanog represses primitive endoderm differentiation and that cell aggregation induces Nanog repression.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: These studies describe how point mutations of the transferrin receptor can cause a microcytic anemia that does not respond to iron therapy and would not be detected by routine iron studies, such as serum ferritin. \n Ret-He was the only red cell marker affected prior to the onset of brain ID. The clinical practice of using anemia as the preferred biomarker for diagnosis of iron deficiency may need reconsidering. \n The restoration of EPO production and EPOR mRNA expression with ASP treatment activated EPOR downstream JAK2/STAT5 and PI3K/Akt signaling, induced their target genes, such as Bcl-xL, Fam132b and Tfrc, and increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio in bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells of CKD rats. \n Transferrin-bound iron binding to transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is essential for cellular iron delivery during erythropoiesis.  \n aken together, decreasing TfR1 expression during \u03b2-thalassemic erythropoiesis, either directly via induced haploinsufficiency or via exogenous apotransferrin, decreases ineffective erythropoiesis and provides an endogenous mechanism to upregulate hepcidin, leading to sustained iron-restricted erythropoiesis and preventing systemic iron overload in \u03b2-thalassemic mice. \n The type 1 transferrin receptor (TfR1) is well known as a key player in erythroid differentiation through its role in iron uptake.  \n The signaling functions of both TfR1 and TfR2 in erythroid cells were unexpected and these recent findings open a new field of research regarding the last steps of erythroid differentiation and their regulation. \n Erythropoiesis requires large amounts of iron for hemoglobin synthesis, which is mainly provided by macrophages and the intestines in a transferrin (Tf)-bound form. \n  In humans, hematopoietic erythroid precursor cells express high levels of TFR1 and specifically take up the FTH homopolymer (H-ferritin). \n We found decreased expression of hepcidin and TfR2 and increased expression of TfR1 and NGAL in the beta-thalassemia mouse models, compared with the control mice. \n Soluble transferrin receptor-1 (sTfR1) concentrations are increased in the plasma under two conditions that are associated with increased iron absorption, i.e. iron deficiency and increased erythropoiesis. \n Hemochromatosis is caused by mutations in HFE, a protein that competes with transferrin (TF) for binding to transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1). \n Here we report that sorting nexin 3 (Snx3) facilitates the recycling of transferrin receptor (Tfrc) and thus is required for the proper delivery of iron to erythroid progenitors. \n These findings provide direct evidence that Tfr1 is essential for hematopoiesis through binding diferric transferrin to supply iron to cells. \n Is the TFR1 gene dispensable for erythropoiesis?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nThe passage mentions several times that TFR1 (type 1 transferrin receptor) is essential for cellular iron delivery during erythropoiesis.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, Tcf3 is a component of the Wnt signaling and a dominant downstream effector in ESCs. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: TCF3, a novel positive regulator of osteogenesis, plays a crucial role in miR-17 modulating the diverse effect of canonical Wnt signaling in different microenvironments \n Furthermore, the role of miR-17 was because of its target gene TCF3 (transcription factor 3), a key transcription factor of canonical Wnt pathway. \n Consequently, Tcf3 knockdown in HCT-R cells restores their sensitivity to the effects of butyrate on Wnt activity and clonal cell growth. Interestingly, the effects of overexpressed Tcf3 differ between HCT-116 and HCT-R cells \n In HCT-R cells, however, the overexpression of Tcf3 inhibits Wnt activity, and the cells are still able to proliferate due to the higher expression levels of cell cycle factors, particularly those driving the G(1) to S transition. \n TCF3 (also known as TCF7L1) is a member of the TCF/LEF transcription factor family that is central in regulating epidermal and embryonic stem cell identity. \n We found that in contrast to ES cells, where it represses Wnt-pathway target genes, TCF3 promotes the expression of a subset of Wnt-responsive genes in breast cancer cells while repressing another distinct target subset. In the normal mouse mammary gland, Tcf3 is highly expressed in terminal end buds, structures that lead duct development \n Tcf3 is essential within the neural ectoderm to maintain anterior character and that its interaction with Hesx1 ensures the repression of Wnt targets in the developing forebrain. \n We report here that a terminal component of the canonical Wnt pathway in ES cells, the transcription factor T-cell factor-3 (Tcf3), co-occupies promoters throughout the genome in association with the pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Nanog.  \n Our results suggest that the Wnt pathway, through Tcf3, brings developmental signals directly to the core regulatory circuitry of ES cells to influence the balance between pluripotency and differentiation. \n The wnt pathway regulates the steady state level of beta-catenin, a transcriptional coactivator for the Tcf3/Lef1 family of DNA binding proteins. \n Along with evidence that a significant amount of Tcf protein is nonnuclear, these findings suggest that CK1epsilon can modulate wnt signaling in vivo by regulating both the beta-catenin-Tcf3 and the GBP-dsh interfaces. \n RA increases the expression of ligands and receptors of the noncanonical Wnt pathway (Wnt 5a, 7a, Fzd2 and Fzd6), downstream signaling, and Tcf3 expression. \n The noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway, through actions of Tcf3, can antagonize the canonical pathway. \n We report here that a terminal component of the canonical Wnt pathway in ES cells, the transcription factor T-cell factor-3 (Tcf3), co-occupies promoters throughout the genome in association with the pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Nanog. \n Both Tcf3 depletion and Wnt pathway activation cause increased expression of Oct4, Nanog, and other pluripotency factors and produce ES cells that are refractory to differentiation. \n Here, we show that injection of a hesx1 morpholino into a 'sensitised' zygotic headless (tcf3) mutant background leads to severe forebrain and eye defects, suggesting an interaction between Hesx1 and the Wnt pathway during zebrafish forebrain development. \n In addition, we reveal that Tcf3 is essential within the neural ectoderm to maintain anterior character and that its interaction with Hesx1 ensures the repression of Wnt targets in the developing forebrain. \n TCF3, a novel positive regulator of osteogenesis, plays a crucial role in miR-17 modulating the diverse effect of canonical Wnt signaling in different microenvironments. \n Our studies located the position of Wnts, downstream LEF1 and TCF3 and stem cell marker proteins, which provide new information in understanding the role of the Wnt singaling pathway in whisker follicles' growth. \n The transcription factor T-cell factor 3 (TCF3), one component of the Wnt pathway, is known as a cell-intrinsic inhibitor of many pluripotency genes in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that influences the balance between pluripotency and differentiation. \n Overexpression of TCF3 attenuated the effect of miR-17 on modulating canonical Wnt signaling. \n We also find that TCF3 phosphorylation is triggered by canonical Wnt ligands, LRP6, and dominant negative mutants for Axin and GSK3, indicating that this process shares the same upstream regulators with \u03b2-catenin stabilization. \n Wnt pathway stimulation also triggers \u03b2-catenin association at regulatory elements with classic Lef/Tcf motifs associated with differentiation programs. \n We show that menin physically interacts with proteins involved in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, including beta-catenin, TCF3 (TCFL1), and weakly with TCF4 (TCFL2). \n T-cell factor 3 (Tcf3) is a component of the Wnt signaling and a dominant downstream effector in ESCs. \n  factor 3 (Tcf3) is a component of the Wnt signaling and a dominant downstream effector in ESCs.

Thus, Tc \n Tcf3, is recruited to a palindromic motif enriched in the promoter of cell cycle repressor genes, such as p15Ink4b, p16Ink4a and p19Arf, which mediate the Wnt-dependent anti-proliferative effect in mESCs.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Excess relative risk of new brain tumor averaged 1.29 (95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.93) for pediatric patients exposed to one or more head CTs. Tumor incidence increased with number of pediatric head CTs in a dose-dependent manner, with measurable excess incidence even after a single scan. Converging evidence from epidemiological studies supported a small excess risk of brain tumor incidence after even a single CT exam in pediatric patients.  \n Recent epidemiologic evidence from a national registry of children who underwent CT scans suggests a higher-than-expected incidence of secondary tumors.  \n However, we found 1) a statistically significant correlation between radiation dose and age at procedure, as well as number and type of procedures, and 2) a substantial increase in lifetime predicted risk of tumor above baseline in the cohort of young children who undergo neurointerventions.CONCLUSIONS: Although neurointerventional procedures have dramatically improved the prognosis of children facing serious cerebrovascular conditions, the predicted risk of secondary tumors, particularly in the youngest patients and those undergoing multiple procedures, is sobering. \n Conclusion When prevalent cases of meningioma at first exposure to CT of the head are excluded, no statistically significant increase in risk of meningioma was found among exposed subjects compared with unexposed control subjects. \n  data suggest that 1 excess brain malignancy occurred after 4000 brain CTs (40 mSv per scan) and that the estimated risk in the 10 years following CT exposure was 1 brain tumor per 10,000 patients exposed to a 10 mGy scan at less than 10 years of age.CONCLU \n SIONS: The model predicts that the effective radiation dose from a single head CT is capable of inducing a thyroid or brain tumor in an infant or child.

The strength of the association varied across the studies. Exclusion of patients with predisposing factors to central nervous system tumors was examined in four studies with a decreased risk to develop central nervous system tumors noted in three studies. Two studies reported nonsignificant reduction in the excess relative risk per milliGray of brain dose after adjusting for predisposing factors, whereas the reduction was significant in one study. The frequency of CT exposure was proportional to the risk of developing tumors in two studies although not significantly maintained in two other studies.  \n RESULTS: The overall risk was not significantly different in the two cohorts (incidence rate=36.72 per 100\u2009000 person-years in the exposed cohort, 28.48 per 100\u2009000 person-years in the unexposed cohort, hazard ratio (HR)=1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.90-1.85). The risk of benign brain tumour was significantly higher in the exposed cohort than in the unexposed cohort (HR=2.97, 95% CI=1.49-5.93). The frequency of CT examination showed strong correlation with the subsequent overall risk of malignancy and benign brain tumour.CONCLUSIONS: We found that paediatric head CT examination was associated with an increased incidence of benign brain tumour. \n CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that CT-related radiation exposure increases brain tumor risk.  \n Compared with the general population, incidence of brain tumors was higher in the cohort of children with CT scans, requiring cautious interpretation of the findings. \n BACKGROUND: Recent studies linking radiation exposure from pediatric computed tomography (CT) to increased risks of leukemia and brain tumors lacked data to control for cancer susceptibility syndromes (CSS).  \n IMPACT: Future studies should identify TSC patients in order to avoid overestimation of brain tumor risks due to radiation exposure from CT scans. \n The radiation-induced occurrence of meningiomas and other brain tumours most probably contributes to the continuously increasing incidence of these diseases which is observed in several industrial nations, as well as the exposure of the bone marrow by CT to the increase of childhood leukaemia. \n 1,000 annual paediatric CT investigations of the skull will lead to about 3 excess neoplasms in the head region, i.e., the probability of an induced late effect must be suspected in the range of some thousandths.  \n Does head ct increase brain tumor risk?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..

    "Let's think step by step. No, exon 38 or 39 KMT2D missense variants cause a condition distinct from Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1). Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: A restricted spectrum of missense KMT2D variants cause a multiple malformations disorder distinct from Kabuki syndrome. \n To investigate if specific exon 38 or 39 KMT2D missense variants (MVs) cause a condition distinct from Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1).METHODS: Multiple individuals, with MVs in exons 38 or 39 of KMT2D that encode a highly conserved region of 54 amino acids flanked by Val3527 and Lys3583, were identified and phenotyped. Functional tests were performed to study their pathogenicity and understand the disease mechanism.RESULTS: The consistent clinical features of the affected individuals, from seven unrelated families, included choanal atresia, athelia or hypoplastic nipples, branchial sinus abnormalities, neck pits, lacrimal duct anomalies, hearing loss, external ear malformations, and thyroid abnormalities. None of the individuals had intellectual disability. The frequency of clinical features, objective software-based facial analysis metrics, and genome-wide peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns in these patients were significantly different from that of KS1. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that these MVs perturb KMT2D secondary structure through an increased disordered to \u0251-helical transition.CONCLUSION: KMT2D MVs located in a specific region spanning exons 38 and 39 and affecting highly conserved residues cause a novel multiple malformations syndrome distinct from KS1. Unlike KMT2D haploinsufficiency in KS1, these MVs likely result in disease through a dominant negative mechanism. \n Do exon 38 or 39 KMT2D missense variants cause Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1)?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe passage states that a restricted spectrum of missense KMT2D variants causes a multiple malformations disorder distinct from Kabuki syndrome.

Updated recommendations for the use of MTX in patients with RA or other rheumatologic disease are proposed. \n Methotrexate has been used in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) since the 1980s and to this day is often the first line medication for RA treatment. \n OBJECTIVE: Most recommendations for the use of methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are issued by developed countries. \n Low dose pulse methotrexate (MTX) has become a widely used therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because of its good response rate profile. With \n Treatment with methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can lead to severe side-effects, especially pulmonary and haematological complications. The ai \n Patients having rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with methotrexate (MTX) are at an increased risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD). Epstei \n Increasingly, methotrexate (MTX) and sulphasalazine (SASP) are used initially for second-line therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Althoug \n OBJECTIVES: The folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX) has become established as the most commonly used disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but is commonly discontinued due to adverse effe \n e suspected methotrexate (MTX)-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) induced by MTX treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). About  \n BACKGROUND: Treatment with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) leads to decreased total immunoglobulin (Ig) levels and impairs vaccine-specific IgG antibody levels following pneumococcal vaccinat \n In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, the concomitant use of methotrexate has been shown to reduce the incidence of antibodies to infliximab (ATI), on the other hand, it is unclear whether azathioprine can reduce ATI production. We enro \n Methotrexate (MTX) is known as a first-line synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). \n Biological treatments are expensive and using SC methotrexate can improve disease control in RA patients, thus potentially avoiding or delaying the requirement for future biological treatment. \n Most recommendations for the use of methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are issued by developed countries. \n We reviewed existing recommendations on the use of MTX for the treatment of RA and summarized areas of agreement that could be relevant for least developed countries (LDCs).M \n st covered some but not all of the following areas: baseline \"pre-MTX\" assessment (7/12;58%), prescription of MTX (10/12;83.3%), management of MTX side effects (6/12;50%), and special considerations (e.g., peri-operative management) (8/12; 66.7%). R \n lectronic databases and registries were searched for recommendations on MTX use in RA, duplicates were eliminated, and the most updated version adopted when there were several versions on the same recommendation.  \n MTX must at the present time be used only in severe RA, refractory to more than one classical slow acting drug. \n MTX is as effective in treating RA as the other second line drugs and always more rapidly effective, perhaps because of anti-inflammatory properties. \n For the low doses used in RA (less than 15 mg/week), MTX is completely and rapidly absorbed with an active process membrane transport. \n Methotrexate, which is used for RA treatment, causes thrombocytopenia. \n Methorexate therapy in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis complicated by idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. \n This case shows that methotrexate may be used in patients diagnosed with RA that is associated with ITP under strict monitoring. \n Here, we report an RA case that also had ITP, which did not decrease in platelet count after methotrexate therapy. \n We started methotrexate therapy 10 mg per week for treatment of RA, and hydroxychloroquine therapy was stopped due to nonresponse. \n Methotrexate (MTX) is the anchor treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has been very thoroughly studied in many different patient populations, as monotherapy and in combination with various other disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic agents, as they became available. \n Although rheumatologists have been using methotrexate in the treatment of RA for some time, controlled studies have been needed to establish the safety and efficacy of this agent. \n Methotrexate is generally the first-line drug for the treatment of RA, psoriatic arthritis and other forms of inflammatory arthritis, and it enhances the effect of most biologic agents in RA. \n Despite the introduction of numerous biologic agents for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other forms of inflammatory arthritis, low-dose methotrexate therapy remains the gold standard in RA therapy. \n A number of studies show the efficacy of methotrexate (MTX) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in general. \n Methotrexate (MTX) is currently the most frequently used drugs in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). \n Methotrexate (MTX) has been the anchor treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over the last 15 years, and is used in combination with biologic agents to enhance efficacy over the last decade or so. \n Is methotrexate used for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nMethotrexate (MTX) is the anchor treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has been very thoroughly studied in many different patient populations, as monotherapy and in combination with various other disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic agents, as they became available.

U \n One site, competitively blocked by bungarotoxin and by curare, is presumably the acetylcholine receptor. \n In neuromuscular junction (NMJ) preparations, movements of the muscle must be inhibited if imaging during stimulation is desired (e.g., by application of curare, a potent acetylcholine receptor inhibitor). \n Curare has long been regarded as a typical competitive antagonist of acetylcholine (ACh) at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction. \n Curare inhibition of wild-type receptors is consistent with curare binding to a single high-affinity binding site [inhibitor constant (Ki) = 20 nM]. \n Phenylalanine substitution for alpha Y198 [alpha Y198F (notation used here: subunit/amino acid in wild-type/residue number/substitution)] causes a 10-fold increase in curare affinity (Ki = 3.1 nM), and measurement of the recovery from curare inhibition indicates that this increase in affinity is due to a reduction in the rate of curare dissociation from the receptor. \n rthermore, sudden increases of research activity are ascribable to historic events, like the first use of curare as muscle relaxant during surgery.DIS \n Recently, however, it has been shown that curare can also block the channels opened by ACh at the frog neuromuscular junction as well as on rat and Aplysia neurones; moreover, curare is able to depolarize rat myotubes and thus behaves as an agonist for the cholinergic receptor of this preparation (see ref. \n In Aplysia nervous tissue, curare appears not to be a specific antagonist for the nicotinic ACh receptor, but rather to be a specific blocking agent for a class of receptor-activated Na+ and Cl- responses. \n The mode of action of curare, a well-known competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at the nicotinic receptor, was examined with the single channel recording technique. \n Does Curare function by stimulating the acetylcholine receptor?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nCurare is a competitive inhibitor of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which means it competes with acetylcholine for binding to the receptor.

The identification of cancers with a significant adenosine drive is critical to understand the potential for these molecules. However, it is challenging to measure tumor adenosine levels at scale, thus novel, clinically tractable biomarkers are needed.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated a gene expression signature for the adenosine signaling using regulatory networks derived from the literature and validated this in patients. We applied the signature to large cohorts of disease from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cohorts of immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated patients.RESULTS: The signature captures baseline adenosine levels in vivo (r 2 = 0.92, P = 0.018), is reduced after small-molecule inhibition of A2AR in mice (r 2 = -0.62, P = 0.001) and humans (reduction in 5 of 7 patients, 70%), and is abrogated after A2AR knockout. Analysis of TCGA confirms a negative association between adenosine and overall survival (OS, HR = 0.6, P < 2.2e-16) as well as progression-free survival (PFS, HR = 0.77, P = 0.0000006). Further, adenosine signaling is associated with reduced OS (HR = 0.47, P < 2.2e-16) and PFS (HR = 0.65, P = 0.0000002) in CD8+ T-cell-infiltrated tumors. Mutation of TGF\u03b2 superfamily members is associated with enhanced adenosine signaling and worse OS (HR = 0.43, P < 2.2e-16). Finally, adenosine signaling is associated with reduced efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in published cohorts (HR = 0.29, P = 0.00012).CONCLUSIONS: These data support the adenosine pathway as a mediator of a successful antitumor immune response, demonstrate the prognostic potential of the signature for immunotherapy, and inform patient selection strategies for adenosine pathway modulators currently in development. \n Is adenosine signaling prognostic for cancer outcome?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nThe article states that adenosine signaling is associated with reduced overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in cancer patients. This suggests that high levels of adenosine signaling in cancer are associated with poorer outcomes, which is the definition of a prognostic marker. Additionally, the article mentions that the adenosine signature is reduced after small-molecule inhibition of A2AR in",

D. mela \n This Zelda-mediated chromatin accessibility facilitates transcription-factor recruitment and early gene expression. \n While analyzing chromatin immunoprecipitation data sets from 21 sequence-specific transcription factors active in the Drosophila embryo, we found that binding of all factors exhibits a dose-dependent relationship with \"TAGteam\" sequence motifs bound by the zinc finger protein Vielfaltig, also known as Zelda, a recently discovered activator of the zygotic genome. \n These different timing classes each associate with binding sites for two transcription factors, GAGA-factor and Zelda, previously implicated in controlling chromatin accessibility at ZGA. \n Together this reveals a distinct requirement for a chromatin remodeller in promoting the activity of the pioneer factor OCT4 and regulating the pluripotency network. \n Chromatin accessibility at OCT4-bound sites requires the chromatin remodeller BRG1, which is recruited to these sites by OCT4 to support additional transcription factor binding and expression of the pluripotency-associated transcriptome. \n The pioneer factor OCT4 requires the chromatin remodeller BRG1 to support gene regulatory element function in mouse embryonic stem cells. \n Pioneer transcription factors recognise and bind their target sequences in inaccessible chromatin to establish new transcriptional networks throughout development and cellular reprogramming. \n During this process, pioneer factors establish an accessible chromatin state to facilitate additional transcription factor binding, yet it remains unclear how different pioneer factors achieve this. \n Here, we discover that the pluripotency-associated pioneer factor OCT4 binds chromatin to shape accessibility, transcription factor co-binding, and regulatory element function in mouse embryonic stem cells. \n Open chromatin is associated with Zelda-bound loci, as well as more generally with regions of active transcription. \n Unexpectedly, chromatin at a large subset of Zelda-bound regions remains open even in the absence of Zelda. \n During this developmental transition, the zygotic genome is largely transcriptionally quiescent and undergoes significant chromatin remodeling. \n Here we used formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements to determine the role of Zelda in regulating regions of open chromatin in the early embryo. \n Pioneer transcription factors can engage nucleosomal DNA, which leads to local chromatin remodeling and to the establishment of transcriptional competence. \n Recently, we showed that Zelda acts through specific chromatin patterns of histone modifications to mark developmental enhancers and active promoters. \n The zinc-finger TF zelda (zld) is essential for the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) in Drosophila melanogaster, where it directly binds over thousand cis-regulatory modules to regulate chromatin accessibility. \n Nonetheless, the extent to which Zelda influences chromatin accessibility across the genome is largely unknown. \n We present evidence that Zld facilitates binding of Dl to regulatory DNA, and that this is associated with increased chromatin accessibility. \n ZRF1 facilitates the remodeling of multiprotein complexes at chromatin and lies at the heart of signaling processes that occur at DNA damage sites and during transcriptional activation. \n We postulate that ZRF1 operates in conjunction with cellular remodeling machines and suggest that on-site remodeling might be a hallmark of many chromatin-associated signaling pathways. \n Reconstituted transcription reactions established that the Brahma (BRM) chromatin-remodeling complex is essential for Zeste-directed activation on nucleosomal templates. \n Is the zelda transcription factor a chromatin remodeller?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n\nZelda facilitates transcriptional activation by accumulating in microenvironments where it could accelerate the duration of multiple pre-initiation steps.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Evaluation of primary DNA-damage is one way to identify potential genotoxic agents and for this purpose the Comet assay has, for the last decades, been used to monitor DNA single strand and double strand breaks in individual cells \n DNA strand-break frequency was examined by means of the comet assay i \n . The comet assay (as this method was subsequently named) was able to measure, for the first time, the fraction of radiobiologically hypoxic cells in mouse and human tumors. It was used to determine that the rate of rejoining of DNA breaks was relatively homogenous within an irradiated population of cells \n The comet assay is frequently used to measure DNA damage in individual cells.  \n Thus a complete repair of DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation and measurable by the Comet assay was observed, whereas the yield of somatic mutations increased in relation to the radiation dose. \n xanthi) mutagenicity assay is the ability to analyze and compare on the same plants under identical treatment conditions both the induced acute DNA damage in somatic cells as measured by the Comet assay and the yield of induced leaf somatic mutations. \n The present study reveals that gamma radiation induces single strand breaks in DNA as measured by alkaline comet assay in bivalves and comet assay serves as a sensitive and rapid method to detect genotoxicity of gamma radiation. \n The present study is aimed (a) to know the genotoxic effect of gamma radiation on aquatic fauna employing two species of selected bivalves, (b) to evaluate the possible use of 'Comet assay' for detecting genetic damage in haemocytes of bivalves as a biomarker for environmental biomonitoring and also (c) to compare the relative sensitivity of two species of bivalves viz. \n The single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay, more commonly known as the comet assay, due to the \"comet-like\" appearance of the cells, was originally developed as a technique to measure the presence of DNA single-strand breaks. \n BACKGROUND: The neutral comet assay was devised to measure double-stranded DNA breaks, but it has also been used to measure apoptosis based on its characteristic DNA fragmentation patterns. \n 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 Gy) of gamma radiation and their genotoxic effects on the haemocytes were studied using the comet assay. \n PURPOSE: The Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Comet assay, being a quick, simple, sensitive, reliable and fairly inexpensive method for measuring DNA strand breaks, has been used to assess DNA damage caused by gamma radiation in developmental stages of maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky. \n This paper attempts a correlation between the induction and repair of DNA damage measured in the comet assay and the clinical observed reaction in order to evaluate the suitability of the comet assay for prediction of radiation sensitivity. \n gle cell gel electrophoresis (e.g., Comet Assay) and immunofluoresence microscopy to detect the presence of gamma-H2AX foci, we find that Cr[VI] induces DNA double-strand breaks similar to ionizing radiation (IR).

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Inactivation of CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells exacerbates colitis-associated colorectal carcinogenesis - a short report. \n CYLD is a tumor suppressor that has been linked to the development of various human malignancies, including colon cancer. The tumor-suppressing function of CYLD is associated with its deubiquitinating activity, which maps to the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein. In the present study we evaluated the role of intestinal epithelial CYLD in colitis-associated cancer using a conditional mouse CYLD inactivation model.METHODS: In order to evaluate the role of CYLD in intestinal epithelial carcinogenesis, mice (IEC-Cyld (\u03949) mice) that carry a mutation that eliminates the deubiquitinating domain of CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) were generated by crossing Villin-Cre transgenic mice to previously generated mice carrying a loxP-flanked Cyld exon 9 (Cyld (flx9) mice).RESULTS: We found that IEC-Cyld (\u03949) mice did not present spontaneous intestinal abnormalities up to one year of age. However, upon challenge with a combination of genotoxic (AOM) and pro-inflammatory (DSS) agents we found that the number of adenomas in the IEC-Cyld (\u03949) mice was dramatically increased compared to the control mice. Inactivation of CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells did not affect the classical nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) and c-Jun kinase (JNK) activation pathways under physiological conditions, suggesting that these pathways do not predispose CYLD-deficient intestinal epithelia to colorectal cancer development before the onset of genotoxic and/or pro-inflammatory stress.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore a critical tumor-suppressing role for functional intestinal epithelial CYLD in colitis-associated carcinogenesis. CYLD expression and its associated pathways in intestinal tumors may be exploited for future prognostic and therapeutic purposes. \n Inactivation of CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells exacerbates colitis-associated colorectal carcinogenesis - a short report \n Does inactivation of CYLD help in colorectal cancer?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe question is asking about the effect of inactivating CYLD in intestinal epithelial cells on colitis-associated colorectal carcinogenesis.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, PDXK mutations cause polyneuropathy responsive to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate supplementation. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: PDXK mutations cause polyneuropathy responsive to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate supplementation. \n To identify disease-causing variants in autosomal recessive axonal polyneuropathy with optic atrophy and provide targeted replacement therapy.METHODS: We performed genome-wide sequencing, homozygosity mapping, and segregation analysis for novel disease-causing gene discovery. We used circular dichroism to show secondary structure changes and isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the impact of variants on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding. Pathogenicity was further supported by enzymatic assays and mass spectroscopy on recombinant protein, patient-derived fibroblasts, plasma, and erythrocytes. Response to supplementation was measured with clinical validated rating scales, electrophysiology, and biochemical quantification.RESULTS: We identified biallelic mutations in PDXK in 5 individuals from 2 unrelated families with primary axonal polyneuropathy and optic atrophy. The natural history of this disorder suggests that untreated, affected individuals become wheelchair-bound and blind. We identified conformational rearrangement in the mutant enzyme around the ATP-binding pocket. Low PDXK ATP binding resulted in decreased erythrocyte PDXK activity and low pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) concentrations. We rescued the clinical and biochemical profile with PLP supplementation in 1 family, improvement in power, pain, and fatigue contributing to patients regaining their ability to walk independently during the first year of PLP normalization.INTERPRETATION: We show that mutations in PDXK cause autosomal recessive axonal peripheral polyneuropathy leading to disease via reduced PDXK enzymatic activity and low PLP. We show that the biochemical profile can be rescued with PLP supplementation associated with clinical improvement. As B6 is a cofactor in diverse essential biological pathways, our findings may have direct implications for neuropathies of unknown etiology characterized by reduced PLP levels.

MIS-C patients had patterns of T cell-biased lymphopenia and T cell activation similar to severely ill adults, and all patients with MIS-C had SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies at admission. \n Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a possible complication of COVID-19, has been described as a hyperinflammatory condition with multiorgan involvement similar to that in Kawasaki

To date, no study has characterized the mucocutaneous features seen in hospitalized children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or the temporal association of these findings with the onset of systemic symptoms.Objective: To describe the mucocutaneous findings seen in children with MIS-C during the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in New York City in 2020.Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective case series was conducted of 35 children admitted to 2 hospitals in New York City between April 1 and July 14, 2020, who met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and/or epidemiologic criteria for MIS-C.Main Outcomes and Measures: Laboratory and clinical characteristics, with emphasis on mucocutaneous findings, of children who met criteria for MIS-C. \n This condition, since defined as the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), is assumed to be a delayed immune response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),

might explain the multisystem-inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) observed in children and cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 patients. \n METHODS: An extensive search strategy was conducted by combining the terms multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and coronavirus infection or using the term multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in bibliographic electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL) and in preprint servers (BioRxiv.org and MedRxiv.org) following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metaanalyses guidelines to retrieve all articles published from January

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: In human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and LAPC4), loss of BRCA2 leads to the castration-resistant phenotype. Co-loss of BRCA2-RB1 in human prostate cancer cells induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which is associated with invasiveness and a more aggressive disease phenotype. Importantly, PARP inhibitors attenuate cell growth in human mCRPC-derived organoids and human CRPC cells harboring single-copy loss of both genes.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that early identification of this aggressive form of prostate cancer offers potential for improved outcomes with early introduction of PARP inhibitor-based therapy. \n Is co-loss of BRCA2-RB1 associated with better prognosis for prostate cancer patients?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe passage states that co-loss of BRCA2-RB1 in human prostate cancer cells induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is associated with invasiveness and a more aggressive disease phenotype.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Salvage gamma knife radiosurgery in the management of dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors: Long-term outcome in a single-institution case series. \n BACKGROUND: Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNT/DNET) are rare epileptogenic tumors. Microsurgery remains the best treatment option, although case reports exist on the use of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in selected cases. We investigated the long-term outcome of GKRS-treated DNTs at our institution in the context of current diagnostic and treatment options. \n Long-term seizure control was obtained after GKRS of two separate residual DNT components along the surgical margin (2005 and 2010). A 27-year-old male undergoing gross total resection of the contrast-enhancing portion of a DNT (1999) resulted in temporary control of intractable epilepsy despite AEDs; lasting clinical control of seizures was achieved in 2002 after GKRS of a small, recurrent DNT component. A 28-year-old male underwent STR of DNT (1994 and 2004) resulting in temporary control of intractable epilepsy. Lasting seizure control was gained after GKRS of a residual tumor (2005).CONCLUSION: GKRS as performed in our series was effective in terms of tumor and seizure control. \n Prospective studies are warranted to establish the role of GKRS in the treatment of DNTs. \n Two rare cases of intractable epilepsy caused by Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumours (DNET) are reported and their different management discussed. The first case required vagal nerve stimulation and radiosurgery while the later was operated with the help of neuronavigation.  \n Salvage gamma knife radiosurgery in the management of dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors: Long-term outcome in a single-institution case series \n Can radiosurgery be used for the DNET tumors?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe article is discussing the management of Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumors (DNETs) and the role of radiosurgery in its treatment.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor Apilimod, cysteine protease inhibitors MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825, and ONO 5334, and the CCR1 antagonist MLN-3897. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: To identify therapeutics that can be repurposed as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, we profiled a library of known drugs encompassing approximately 12,000 clinical-stage or FDA-approved small molecules. Here, we report the identification of 30 known drugs that inhibit viral replication. Of these, six were characterized for cellular dose-activity relationships, and showed effective concentrations likely to be commensurate with therapeutic doses in patients. These include the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor Apilimod, cysteine protease inhibitors MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825, and ONO 5334, and the CCR1 antagonist MLN-3897. Since many of these molecules have advanced into the clinic, the known pharmacological and human safety profiles of these compounds will accelerate their preclinical and clinical evaluation for COVID-19 treatment. \n Is the apilimod inhibitor effective against SARS-CoV-2?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe passage states that the authors identified 30 known drugs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, and among them, six were characterized for cellular dose-activity relationships. Apilimod is one of the six drugs that were characterized, and it showed an effective concentration likely to be commensurate with therapeutic doses in patients. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.",
