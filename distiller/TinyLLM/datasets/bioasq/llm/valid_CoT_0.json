    "Let's think step by step. Yes, defects in recombination repair are involved in carcinogenesis. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Inherited mutations in genes involved in HR are associated with gene rearrangement and may be a prerequisite for tumor development in some cancer-prone hereditary diseases like Bloom, Werner and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes. \n The link between loss or defect in functional BRCA1 and predisposition for development of ovarian and breast cancer is well established. Germ-line mutations in BRCA1 are responsible for both hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, which is around 5-10% for all breast and 10-15% of all ovarian cancer cases. \n Aberrant RAD9 expression has been linked to breast, lung, thyroid, skin and prostate tumorigenesis, and a cause-effect relationship has been demonstrated for the latter two. Interestingly, human RAD9 overproduction correlates with prostate cancer whereas deletion of Mrad9, the corresponding mouse gene, in keratinocytes leads to skin cancer. \n A DNA double-strand break (DSB) has long been recognized as a severe cellular lesion, potentially representing an initiating event for carcinogenesis or cell death. \n Breast carcinogenesis, particularly in familial cases, has been linked with a defect in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway, \n Detection of pathway-specific error-prone DSB repair activities by functional testing was proposed to serve as biomarker for hereditary breast cancer risk and responsiveness to therapies targeting HR dysfunction. \n Brca1 deficiency leads to the development of breast cancer. \n Furthermore, activation of Akt1 was involved in Brca1-deficiency-mediated tumorigenesis in mice. Defective homologous recombination (HR) is thought to be a major contributor to tumorigenesis in Brca1 deficiency. \n human tumor viruses may manipulate cellular DNA-damage responses to promote cancer. \n HTLV-1 p30 may facilitate the accumulation of mutations in the host genome and the cumulative risk of transformation. \n PALB2 interacts with BRCA1 and BRCA2 in supercomplexes involved in DNA repair via homologous recombination. Heterozygous germline mutations in PALB2 confer a moderate risk of breast cancer, while biallelic PALB2 mutations are linked to a severe form of Fanconi anaemia characterized by early childhood solid tumours and severe chromosomal instability. \n the effects of WRN silencing on cell proliferation and genomic instability are modulated probably by other genetic factors, including p53, which might play a role in the carcinogenesis induced by WRN deficiency. \n WRN depletion in HL60 cells led to the hyper-activation of homologous recombination repair via up-regulation of RAD51 and BLM protein levels. This resulted in DNA damage disrepair, \n DNA-repair pathways recognise and repair DNA damaged by exogenous and endogenous agents to maintain genomic integrity. Defects in these pathways lead to replication errors, loss or rearrangement of genomic material and eventually cell death or carcinogenesis. \n This review mainly focuses on various roles of human RecQ helicases in the process of recombination-based DNA repair to maintain genome stability and physiological consequences of their defects in the development of cancer and premature aging. \n defective DNA double-strand break repair can lead to toxicity and large scale sequence rearrangements that cause cancer and promote premature aging. \n The specific DNA repair systems for which there are data regarding the impact of repair defects on stem cell function include O(6)-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase, nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, mismatch repair, non-homologous DNA end-joining Fanconi's anemia protein complex, and homologous recombination. It has recently become clear that deficiencies of these processes are associated not only with cancer and/or aging but also with stem cell defects. \n The breast- and ovarian-specific tumor suppressor, BRCA1, has been implicated to function in many nuclear processes, including DNA damage repair, recombination, transcription, ubiquitination, cell cycle checkpoint enforcement, and centrosome regulation. \n We review the genes and proteins related to the homologous recombinational repair (HRR) pathway that are implicated in cancer through either genetic disorders that predispose to cancer through chromosome instability or the occurrence of somatic mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis. \n The breast cancer-associated BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are strongly implicated in HRR \n XRCC3 function is not limited to HR initiation, but extends to later stages in formation and resolution of HR intermediates, possibly by stabilizing heteroduplex DNA. The results further demonstrate that HR defects can promote genomic instability not only through failure to initiate HR (leading to nonhomologous repair) but also through aberrant processing of HR intermediates. Both mechanisms may contribute to carcinogenesis in HR-deficient cells. \n Inaccurate repair or lack of repair of a DSB can lead to mutations or to larger-scale genomic instability through the generation of dicentric or acentric chromosomal fragments. Such genome changes may have tumourigenic potential. \n Here, I provide an overview of these systems, with particular emphasis on the two major pathways of DSB repair: non-homologous end-joining and homologous recombination. Inherited or acquired defects in these pathways may lead to cancer or to other human diseases, \n enhanced telomeric recombination in human cells with mismatch-repair defects may contribute to cell immortalization and hence tumorigenesis. \n Homologous recombination repair plays an important role in DSB repair and impairment of this repair mechanism may lead to loss of genomic integrity, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Recent research has shown that the tumor suppressor genes p53 and BRCA1 and -2 are involved in the proper control of homologous recombination, suggesting a role of this type of repair in human cancer. \n Human cells can process DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by either homology directed or non-homologous repair pathways. Defects in components of DSB repair pathways are associated with a predisposition to cancer. The products of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which normally confer protection against breast cancer, are involved in homology-directed DSB repair. \n We further demonstrate that WRN depletion leads to hyper-activated homologous recombination repair via up-regulation of RAD51 and BLM, which in turn results in DNA damage disrepair and chromosomal aberrations \n Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nThe passage states that defects in recombination repair pathways lead to genomic instability, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer.

The Kaplan-Meier analysis also showed significantly worse cumulative survival rates in the 'lower' T3 group (P<0.001). In the Cox regression analysis, low T3 was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality even after adjusting for traditional risk factors (hazard ratio=3.76, P=0.021).  \n In CKD patients with proteinuria, low T3 concentration predicted all-cause mortality and cardiovascular event independently of the severity of proteinuria. \n Low-T3 syndrome is a frequent finding among HD patients, but it does not predict outcome.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Involvement of the dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 in c-Jun N-terminal kinase inactivation following cerebral ischemia in the rat hippocampus. \n The results revealed upregulation of dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) activity at 4\u00a0h of reperfusion in rat hippocampi.  \n This study examines the molecular mechanism underlying JNK dephosphorylation and inactivation evoked by dual-specificity phosphates following cerebral ischemia. \n Phosphatases play a particularly important role in this respect, by tightly controlling MAPK phosphorylation and activation. M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK and, to a lesser extent, p38 MAPKs and is found in a complex with these kinases, along with other pathway components, held together by scaffold proteins.  \n Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) play a very important role in these events by modulating the extent of JNK phosphorylation and activation and thus regulating cellular responses to stress.

M3/6 is the first phosphatase of this family to display highly specific inactivation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases.  \n We previously demonstrated that the dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) MKP7 and M3/6 bind the scaffold JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) and inactivate the bound subset of JNK (1). \n the dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 \n  dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) \n M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK  \n the M3/6 dual-specificity phosphatase \n M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK \n M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK \n The dual specificity phosphatases M3/6 and MKP-3 are highly selective for inactivation of distinct mitogen-activated protein kinases. \n The results revealed upregulation of dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) activity at 4\u00a0h of reperfusion in rat hippocampi.  \n Phosphorylation of the M3/6 dual-specificity phosphatase enhances the activation of JNK by arsenite. \n Indeed, expanded polyglutamine impaired the solubility of the dual-specificity JNK phosphatase M3/6. \n Regulation of dual-specificity phosphatases M3/6 and hVH5 by phorbol esters. \n M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK. \n The dual specificity phosphatases M3/6 and MKP-3 are highly selective for inactivation of distinct mitogen-activated protein kinases. \n M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK [7, 8] \n M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK \n Here we describe how diverse cellular stresses affect differently the stability and activity of a JNK-inactivating dual-specificity threonine-tyrosine phosphatase M3/6 \n M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK \n The dual specificity phosphatases M3/6 and MKP-3 are highly selective for inactivation of distinct mitogen-activated protein kinases. \n M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK [7, 8] \n Phosphorylation of the M3/6 dual-specificity phosphatase enhances the activation of JNK by arsenite. \n Regulation of dual-specificity phosphatases M3/6 and hVH5 by phorbol esters.

Yes, Dicer is a component of the protein machinery (the RNA Induced Silencing Complex [RISC]) which is involved in catalyzing the formation of mature microRNAs from their precursors in the process of microRNA biogenesis. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Dicer is a component of the protein machinery (the RNA Induced Silencing Complex [RISC]) which is involved in catalyzing the formation of mature microRNAs from their precursors in the process of microRNA biogenesis. \n RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) Proteins PACT, TRBP, and Dicer are SRA binding nuclear receptor coregulators. \n The cytoplasmic RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) contains dsRNA binding proteins, including protein kinase RNA activator (PACT), transactivation response RNA binding protein (TRBP), and Dicer, that process pre-microRNAs into mature microRNAs (miRNAs) that target specific mRNA species for regulation.  \n  Although the major RNAi pathway proteins are found in most subcellular compartments, the miRNA- and siRNA-loaded Ago2 populations co-sediment almost exclusively with the rER membranes, together with the RISC loading complex (RLC) factors Dicer, TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) and protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase (PACT). \n RNA interference (RNAi) is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are liberated from double-stranded (ds)RNA precursors by Dicer and guide the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to targets. \n . Dicer, an RNase III enzyme, plays a central role in the RNAi pathway by cleaving precursors of both of these classes of RNAs to form mature siRNAs and miRNAs, which are then loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).  \n Canonical siRNAs are 21 nucleotides (nt) in length and are loaded to the RNA Induced Silencing Complex when introduced into the cells, while longer siRNA molecules are first processed by endogenous Dicer and thus termed Dicer-substrate siRNA (DsiRNA).  \n Is Dicer part of the RISC loading complex?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\n\nAccording to the passage, the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) contains dsRNA binding proteins, including protein kinase RNA activator (PACT), transactivation response RNA binding protein (TRBP), and Dicer.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Dysfunction of the gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43), an established miR-1 target, during cardiac hypertrophy leads to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT). \n miR-1 overexpression may contribute to the increased susceptibility of the heart to AVB, which provides us novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ischemic cardiac arrhythmias. \n The incidence of AVB was higher in miR-1 Tg mice than that in wild-type (WT) mice.  \n As miR-1 has been shown in animal models and clinical studies to contribute to arrhythmogenesis by regulating pacemaker channel genes, our finding of miR-1 up-regulation in patients with myocardial infarction indicates that it might be responsible for the higher risk for arrhythmias in these patients.  \n Lately, some highlight articles revealed that the altered expression of miRNAs such as miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-208 etc in hearts also contributed to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and arrhythmias. \n MicroRNA-1 (miR-1) reciprocally regulates inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir)2.1 expression in coronary disease, contributing to arrhythmogenesis.  \n miR-1 levels are greatly reduced in human AF, possibly contributing to up-regulation of Kir2.1 subunits, leading to increased I(K1). Because up-regulation of inward-rectifier currents is important for AF maintenance, these results provide potential new insights into molecular mechanisms of AF with potential therapeutic implications. \n The muscle-specific miR-1 has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy, heart development, cardiac stem cell differentiation, and arrhythmias through targeting of regulatory proteins.  \n We conclude that the beta-adrenergic pathway can stimulate expression of arrhythmogenic miR-1, contributing to ischaemic arrhythmogenesis, and beta-blockers produce their beneficial effects partially by down-regulating miR-1, which might be a novel strategy for ischaemic cardioprotection. \n MiR-1 influences susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. \n Changes in abundance of muscle-specific microRNA, miR-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure. \n In the presence of isoproterenol, rhythmically paced, miR-1-overexpressing myocytes exhibited spontaneous arrhythmogenic oscillations of intracellular Ca(2+), events that occurred rarely in control myocytes under the same conditions. \n Here we show that miR-1 is overexpressed in individuals with coronary artery disease, and that when overexpressed in normal or infarcted rat hearts, it exacerbates arrhythmogenesis. Elimination of miR-1 by an antisense inhibitor in infarcted rat hearts relieved arrhythmogenesis. \n  Thus, miR-1 may have important pathophysiological functions in the heart, and is a potential antiarrhythmic target. \n miR-1 overexpression may contribute to the increased susceptibility of the heart to AVB, which provides us novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ischemic cardiac arrhythmias. \n MiR-1 influences susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias after myocardial infarction \n The muscle-specific miR-1 has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy, heart development, cardiac stem cell differentiation, and arrhythmias through targeting of regulatory proteins \n Changes in abundance of muscle-specific microRNA, miR-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure \n Changes in abundance of muscle-specific microRNA, miR-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure \n The muscle-specific miR-1 has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy, heart development, cardiac stem cell differentiation, and arrhythmias through targeting of regulatory proteins \n Changes in abundance of muscle-specific microRNA, miR-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure \n Changes in abundance of muscle-specific microRNA, miR-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure \n Changes in abundance of muscle-specific microRNA, miR-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure \n Changes in abundance of muscle-specific microRNA, miR-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure \n Is micro RNA 1 (miR-1) implicated in cardiac arrhythmias?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe passage mentions that changes in abundance of muscle-specific microRNA, miR-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure (lines 1-3, 6-8).

    "Let's think step by step. No, magnesium sulfate does not improve outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: CONCLUSION: Patients assigned a higher serum magnesium concentration had a reduced incidence of vasospasm as seen by angiography, but the difference was not statistically significant. Clinically significant outcomes were not different between groups. \n 158 patients (26\u00b72%) had poor outcome in the magnesium group compared with 151 (25\u00b73%) in the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] 1\u00b703, 95% CI 0\u00b785-1\u00b725). Our updated meta-analysis of seven randomised trials involving 2047 patients shows that magnesium is not superior to placebo for reduction of poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (RR 0\u00b796, 95% CI 0\u00b786-1\u00b708). INTERPRETATION: Intravenous magnesium sulphate does not improve clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, therefore routine administration of magnesium cannot be recommended.  \n There is a tendency in the magnesium group to have better outcomes.  \n Due to inconsistently reported benefits and the occurrence of side effects, phase II data suggested that intravenous magnesium for SAH provided either no overall net benefit or uncertain trade-offs. Benefit was likewise not supported in the single phase III clinical trial. \n tatistically significant clinical benefits could not be demonstrated for the other drugs (clazosentan, statins, and magnesium). CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient evidence is available to support the use of the triple-H therapy, clazosentan, statins, or magnesium sulfate for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.  \n Magnesium sulfate decreased the rate of cerebral infarction, but not of DCI or poor functional outcome. Regarding outcome, a beneficial effect of magnesium sulfate on outcome can not be ruled out because of sample size limitations. \n CONCLUSIONS: The present findings do not lend support to a beneficial effect of magnesium sulphate infusion on delayed cerebral infarction. The reduction in DCI and improvement in the clinical outcomes of aneurysmal SAH patients following magnesium sulphate infusion observed in previous pilot studies are not confirmed, although a beneficial effect cannot be ruled out because of sample size limitation. \n Favorable outcome (Good recovery and moderate disability, as defined by Glasgow Outcome Scale) was achieved in 20 of 30 (67%) patients receiving magnesium sulfate infusion and 16 of 30 (53%) patients receiving placebo treatment, p = 0.292, odds ratio 1.750, 95% CI 0.616-4.974. \n Similarly, the pooled odds ratio for favorable outcome is 1.598, 95% CI 1.074-2.377, statistically significant.  \n RESULTS: The worst clinical outcomes at 6 months were seen in MgSO(4) group patients, with mean plasma magnesium concentrations in the fourth quartile, and in placebo group patients, with mean such concentrations in the third and fourth quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found to suggest that a higher mean plasma magnesium concentration improves clinical outcomes. On the contrary, we found an association between high plasma magnesium concentration and worse clinical outcomes. \n The proportions of patients with a favorable outcome at 6 months (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale 5 to 8) were similar, 64% in the magnesium sulfate group and 63% in the saline group (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.6). Secondary outcome analyses (modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Short Form 36, and clinical vasospasm) also showed no significant differences between the 2 groups.  \n CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support a clinical benefit of intravenous magnesium sulfate infusion over placebo infusion in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. \n Magnesium infusion reduced the risk of poor outcome and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI): the relative risk was 0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.83) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.53-1.00), respectively.  \n CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggests that intravenous magnesium therapy reduces the risk of DCI and poor outcome after aneurysmal SAH.  \n The incidence of delayed ischemic infarction was significantly lower in magnesium-treated patients (22% vs. 51%; p = .002); 34 of 54 magnesium patients and 27 of 53 control patients reached good outcome (p = .209). \n BACKGROUND: A meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit.  \n These data imply that intravenous magnesium therapy, besides a supposed beneficial effect on outcome, also provides pain relief for SAH patients, for whom it might also improve functional outcome. \n Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  \n In a phase II randomized clinical trial of 283 patients, magnesium treatment reduced the risk of DCI by 34% and of poor outcome by 23%. \n BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that high-dose MgSO4 therapy is safe and reduces the incidence of DIND and subsequent poor outcome after SAH.  \n On-treatment analysis showed a significantly better outcome after 3 months (P = .017) and a trend toward better outcome after 1 year (P = .083).  \n  CONCLUSIONS: High-dose MgSO4 therapy might be efficient as a prophylactic adjacent therapy after SAH to reduce the risk for poor outcome.  \n There was no significant difference in mortality rate at discharge (p = 0.328). A trend toward improved outcome as measured by the modifed Rankin Scale (p = 0.084), but not the Glasgow Outcome Scale (p = 1.0), was seen in the MgSO4 treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the results suggests that MgSO4 infusion may have a role in cerebral vasospasm prophylaxis if therapy is initiated within 48 hours of aneurysm rupture. \n There was, however, no difference between groups in functional recovery or Glasgow Outcome Scale score.  \n Patients receiving MgSO4 tended to have fewer neurological deficits, better functional recovery and an improved score in GOS.  \n CONCLUSIONS: MgSO4 infusion after aneurysmal SAH is well tolerated and may be useful in producing better outcome. \n CONCLUSION: Magnesium did not seem to interfere in vasospasm frequency but apparently acted favorably in decreasing morbidity and length of hospital stay. \n None of the patients died; no CT evidence of ischemic infarction was present; and most had good outcomes (GOS 5 in 10 patients; GOS 4 in 8 patients). \n At that time, 18 patients in the treatment group and 6 in the placebo group had an excellent outcome (risk ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.9). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that magnesium reduces DCI and subsequent poor outcome, but the results are not yet definitive.  \n We observed a trend in which a higher percentage of patients obtained GOS scores of 4 or 5 in the group treated with MgSO4, but the trend did not reach a statistically significant level.  \n Magnesium sulfate treatment improves outcome in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage: a meta-analysis study. \n BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pilot clinical trials using magnesium sulfate in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage have reported trends toward improvement in clinical outcomes. \n Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. \n Our results indicate that although there was reduced likelihood of a poor outcome for patients treated with magnesium sulfate after SAH, patient mortality was not improved. \n CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support a clinical benefit of intravenous magnesium sulfate infusion over placebo infusion in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. \n CONCLUSION: Administration of intra-arterial magnesium sulfate in combination with nicardipine was well tolerated in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm without a

    "Let's think step by step. No, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. \n We begin by showing that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs. In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. This observation raises the possibility that CNVs that arise somatically and are relatively newly formed are less likely to have established a CNV profile that is depleted for UCEs. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state. In support of this latter explanation, somatic CNVs that are not associated with disease are depleted for UCEs. Finally, we show that it is possible to observe the CNVs of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells become depleted of UCEs over time, suggesting that depletion may be established through selection against UCE-disrupting CNVs without the requirement for meiotic divisions. \n Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. \n Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. \n Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. \n Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. \n Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. \n Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. \n Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. \n Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. \n Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. \n Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. \n Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state. \n Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. \n Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state. \n Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. \n Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state. \n Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. \n Is the abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements disfavored in cancer cells?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: De novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates. \n Evolutionary innovation relies partially on changes in gene regulation. While a growing body of evidence demonstrates that such innovation is generated by functional changes or translocation of regulatory elements via mobile genetic elements, the de novo generation of enhancers from non-regulatory/non-mobile sequences has, to our knowledge, not previously been demonstrated. Here we show evidence for the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates. For this, we took advantage of the massive gene loss following the last whole genome duplication in teleosts to systematically identify regions that have lost their coding capacity but retain sequence conservation with mammals. We found that these regions show enhancer activity while the orthologous coding regions have no regulatory activity. These results demonstrate that these enhancers have been de novo generated in fish.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, dichlorphenamide is carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). \n In one study dichlorphenamide (DCP) vs placebo was tested in two groups of participants: 42 with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) and 31 with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP), based on clinical criteria. Thirty-four of 42 participants with hypokalemic periodic paralysis completed both treatment phases. For the 34 participants having attack rate data for both treatment phases, the mean improvement in attack rate (P = 0.02) and severity-weighted attack rate (P = 0.01) on DCP relative to placebo were statistically significant.  \n AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The largest included study that met our inclusion criteria suggested that DCP was effective in the prevention of episodic weakness in both hypokalemic and hyperkalemic periodic paralyses. \n For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.  \n Chronically, acetazolamide, dichlorphenamide, or potassium-sparing diuretics decrease attack frequency and severity but are of little value acutely.  \n  In the HypoPP trial, there were 13 subjects who exhibited a preference (in terms of the end point) for either DCP or placebo, and 11 of these preferred DCP. In the PSPP trial, DCP significantly reduced attack rates relative to placebo. DCP also significantly reduced attack rates relative to placebo in the HypoPP subjects. We conclude that DCP is effective in the prevention of episodic weakness in both HypoPP and PSPP. \n Diclofenamid has now already been administered for 2 years. It is well tolerated and has suppressed further attacks. \n Three patients with Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis (HOPP)-associated progressive interattack muscle weakness, who became unresponsive or worsened by acetazolamide, responded favorably to dichlorophenamide, a more potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Dichlorophenamide in single-blind placebo-controlled trials, considerably improved functional strength in two of the patients and had a moderate but definite effect in the third. \n Dichlorophenamide should be considered as an alternate to acetazolamide in the treatment of patients with HOPP-associated interattack muscle weakness who have become unresponsive or worsened by acetazolamide. \n Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). \n For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. \n Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). \n For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. \n Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). \n For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. \n BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP).

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, brown fat cells are specialized to dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: WAT and BAT are both involved in energy balance. WAT is mainly involved in the storage and mobilization of energy in the form of triglycerides, whereas BAT specializes in dissipating energy as heat during cold- or diet-induced thermogenesis. \n Because brown adipose\u00a0tissue (BAT) dissipates energy in the form of heat, increasing energy expenditure by augmenting BAT-mediated thermogenesis may represent an approach to counter obesity and its complications. \n Classic brown fat and inducible beige fat both dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat through the actions of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1. This nonshivering thermogenesis is crucial for mammals as a defense against cold and obesity/diabetes. \n Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 in brown fat cells produces heat by dissipating the energy generated by fatty acid and glucose oxidation. \n Brown fat biology and thermogenesis. \n Brown fat (brown adipose tissue, BAT) primary function is to produce heat.  \n Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production. \n Calorimetric measurements from cell suspensions showed that ATP increased basal heat production of isolated brown fat cells by approximately 40% but had no effect on the greater than fivefold increase in heat production seen with maximal adrenergic stimulation. \n Classic brown fat and inducible beige fat both dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat through the actions of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1. \n Brown adipocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or to excessive energy intake; stimulation of brown fat development and function may thus counteract obesity. \n The occurrence of Types 1 and/or 6 cells that has been revealed in 65 out of the total 180 samples (36%), suggests that the oxidation of fat for the thermogenesis proceeds in the brown fat tissue and that brown fat cells partially undergo fat depletion. \n Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production. \n In response to cold, both classical brown fat and the newly identified \"beige\" or \"brite\" cells are activated by \u03b2-adrenergic signaling and catabolize stored lipids and carbohydrates to produce heat via UCP1 \n The ability of brown adipocytes (fat cells) to dissipate energy as heat shows great promise for the treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders \n Inappropriate heat dissipation ignites brown fat thermogenesis in mice with a mutant thyroid hormone receptor \u03b11 \n Brown fat and vascular heat dissipation: The new cautionary tail \n Brown adipose produces heat as a defense against hypothermia and obesity, and the appearance of brown-like adipocytes within white adipose tissue depots is associated with improved metabolic phenotypes.  \n In the same manner, marked ability to produce a considerable amount of heat was evidenced in  brown fat tissue of children and teenagers.  \n Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production.  \n It is inferred that brown-adipose-tissue heat production is reduced during (and probably also some time after) anesthesia.  \n Parallel measurements of heat production and thermogenin content in brown fat cells during cold acclimation of rats. \n The classical white adipose tissue builds up energy in the form of triglycerides and is useful for preventing fatigue during periods of low caloric intake and the brown adipose tissue instead of inducing fat accumulation can produce energy as heat. \n In response to cold, both classical brown fat and the newly identified \"beige\" or \"brite\" cells are activated by \u03b2-adrenergic signaling and catabolize stored lipids and carbohydrates to produce heat via UCP1. \n White adipose tissue stores energy reserves as fat, whereas the metabolic function of brown adipose tissue is lipid oxidation to produce heat. \n The main function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is to produce heat in response to cold. \n Brown adipocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or caloric overfeeding. \n Brown fat (brown adipose tissue, BAT) primary function is to produce heat. \n Adipose tissue plays an active role in energy balance because it is not only a lipid storing and mobilizing tissue but consists of functionally specialized tissues able to produce heat (in brown adipose tissue) and to produce or release a vast number of so called adipokines or adipocytokines. \n Brown adipose tissue (BAT), a specialized fat that dissipates energy to produce heat, plays an important role in the regulation of energy balance. \n Brown adipose cells are specialized to dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat, as a physiological defence against cold and obesity. \n In the present study, the thermogenesis of human brown fat tissue was suggested chiefly with regard to the occurrence of Types 1 and/or 6 cells. \n In the same manner, marked ability to produce a considerable amount of heat was evidenced in  brown fat tissue of children and teenagers. \n Adult humans have heat-producing and energy-consuming brown adipose tissue in the clavicular region of the neck. \n Brown and beige adipocytes expend chemical energy to produce heat and are therefore important in regulating body temperature and body weight. \n In human perirenal brown fat tissue, darkly stained fat-depleted cells (D) occupy, with other cell types (CR, CR'), an important part in the reversible heat production cycle of the brown fat tissue. \n Brown fat is a specialized fat depot that can increase energy expenditure and produce heat. \n Do brown fat cells produce heat?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step. (a) Brown fat cells produce heat is the correct answer. Brown fat cells are mainly involved in the storage and mobilization of energy in the form of triglycerides, whereas BAT specializes in dissipating energy as heat during cold- or diet-induced thermogenesis.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, RNA polymerase II has RNA cleavage activity. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: In addition to RNA synthesis, multisubunit RNA polymerases (msRNAPs) support enzymatic reactions such as intrinsic transcript cleavage. \n msRNAP active sites from different species appear to exhibit differential intrinsic transcript cleavage efficiency and have likely evolved to allow fine-tuning of the transcription process. \n Here we show that a single amino-acid substitution in the trigger loop (TL) of Saccharomyces RNAP II, Rpb1 H1085Y, engenders a gain of intrinsic cleavage activity where the substituted tyrosine appears to participate in acid-base chemistry at alkaline pH for both intrinsic cleavage and nucleotidyl transfer.  \n The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex. \n The transcription factor TFIIS zinc ribbon dipeptide Asp-Glu is critical for stimulation of elongation and RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II \n By site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that invariant residues Asp-261 and Glu-262 of the nucleic acid-binding TFIIS Zn ribbon are critical for stimulation of both elongation and RNA cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II. \n Complexes of yeast RNA polymerase II and RNA are substrates for TFIIS-induced RNA cleavage. \n RNA in such RNA-RNA polymerase complexes undergoes reactions previously thought to be unique to nascent RNA in ternary complexes with DNA, including TFIIS-dependent cleavage and elongation by 3'-terminal addition of NMP from NTP. \n Nascent RNA cleavage by arrested RNA polymerase II does not require upstream translocation of the elongation complex on DNA. \n Here we show that in the presence of SII and nucleotides, transcript cleavage is detected during SII-dependent elongation but not during SII-independent transcription.  \n under typical transcription conditions, SII is necessary but insufficient to activate RNA cleavage. RNA cleavage could serve to move RNA polymerase II away from the transcriptional impediment and/or permit RNA polymerase II multiple attempts at RNA elongation. \n SII is an RNA polymerase II-binding protein that stimulates transcription elongation and also activates nascent transcript cleavage by RNA polymerase II in elongation complexes in vitro \n The RNA polymerase II elongation complex. Factor-dependent transcription elongation involves nascent RNA cleavage. \n Cleavage was not restricted to an elongation complex arrested at this particular site, showing that nascent RNA hydrolysis is a general property of RNA polymerase II elongation complexes. \n Elongation factor SII (also known as TFIIS) is an RNA polymerase II binding protein that allows bypass of template arrest sites by activating a nascent RNA cleavage reaction. \n During gene transcription, the RNA polymerase (Pol) active center can catalyze RNA cleavage. \n During gene transcription, the RNA polymerase (Pol) active center can catalyze RNA cleavage. \n The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex. \n Rpb9, a small subunit of RNA polymerase II, enhances the cleavage stimulation activity of S-II. \n These results suggest that both S-II and Rpb9 maintain transcriptional fidelity by stimulating the cleavage activity intrinsic to RNA polymerase II. \n It is also possible that the transcript cleavage activity of RNA polymerase II represents a proofreading function of the enzyme.. \n Nascent RNA cleavage by arrested RNA polymerase II does not require upstream translocation of the elongation complex on DNA. \n Intrinsic transcript cleavage in yeast RNA polymerase II elongation complexes. \n Does RNA polymerase II have RNA cleavage activity?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe passage mentions that multisubunit RNA polymerases (msRNAPs) support enzymatic reactions such as intrinsic transcript cleavage.

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, TFIIS reactivates the backtracked complexes and promotes pol II transcription through the nucleosome. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Transcript cleavage factor TFIIS reactivates the backtracked complexes and promotes pol II transcription through the nucleosome.  \n The same nucleosomes transcribed in the opposite orientation form a weaker, more diffuse barrier that is largely relieved by higher salt, TFIIS, or FACT \n The system contains natural or recombinant histones, chromatin assembly factors, the histone-acetyltransferase p300, all components of the general transcription machinery, general coactivators and the elongation factor SII (TFIIS). \n Efficient and rapid nucleosome traversal by RNA polymerase II depends on a combination of transcript elongation factors. \n We now show that although TFIIF or TFIIS alone is modestly stimulatory for nucleosome traversal, both factors together increase transcription through nucleosomes in a synergistic manner. \n Significantly, we found that nucleosomes with a Sin mutant histone are traversed to the same extent and at nearly the same rate as equivalent pure DNA templates if both TFIIS and TFIIF are present. \n After partial uncoiling of nucleosomal DNA from histone octamer by Pol II and backtracking of the enzyme, nucleosomal DNA recoils on the octamer, locking Pol II in the arrested state. Histone chaperones and transcription factors TFIIS, TFIIF and FACT facilitate transcription through chromatin using different molecular mechanisms. \n Transcript cleavage factor TFIIS reactivates the backtracked complexes and promotes pol II transcription through the nucleosome. \n The highly conserved eukaryotic transcriptional elongation factor TFIIS enables RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to read though pause or termination sites, nucleosomes and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. \n We also studied the effect of TFIIF and TFIIS on transcription of nucleosomes containing a Sin mutant histone. \n The same nucleosomes transcribed in the opposite orientation form a weaker, more diffuse barrier that is largely relieved by higher salt, TFIIS, or FACT. \n Does TFIIS affect nucleosome positioning?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.. The passage says that TFIIS reactivates backtracked complexes and promotes transcription through nucleosomes. This means that TFIIS can move past nucleosomes. If TFIIS can move past nucleosomes, then it can also affect nucleosome positioning. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.",

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 57-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus taking a combination of canagliflozin and metformin who presented with progressive altered mental status over the previous 2\u00a0days. Her work-up demonstrated a metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 38 and a venous serum pH of 7.08. The serum glucose was 168\u00a0mg/dL. The urinalysis showed glucose>500\u00a0mg/dL and ketones of 80\u00a0mg/dL. Further evaluation demonstrated an elevated serum osmolality of 319 mOsm/kg and an acetone concentration of 93\u00a0mg/dL. She was treated with intravenous insulin and fluids, and the metabolic abnormalities and her altered mental status resolved within 36\u00a0h. This was the first episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) for this patient. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Diabetic patients on SGLT2 inhibitor medications are at risk for ketoacidosis.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: Screening for breast cancer in male-to-female transsexuals should be undertaken for those with additional risk factors (e.g., family history, BRCA2 mutation, Klinefelter syndrome) and should be available to those who desire screening, preferably in a clinical trial. \n Klinefelter syndrome (OR = 24.7; 95% CI = 8.94 to 68.4) and gynecomastia (OR = 9.78; 95% CI = 7.52 to 12.7) were also statistically significantly associated with risk, relations that were independent of BMI.  \n Male breast cancer risk factors show strong association with BRCA2 mutations, as well as Klinefelter syndrome.  \n The main risk factors include: the mutation of genes BRCA 1 and 2, Klinefelter's syndrome, alcohol, liver disease, obesity.  \n Although aetiology is still unclear, constitutional, environmental, hormonal (abnormalities in estrogen/androgen balance) and genetic (positive family history, Klinefelter syndrome, mutations in BRCA1 and specially BRCA2) risk factors are already known.  \n The largest study found 19.2- and 57.8-fold increases in incidence and mortality, respectively, with particularly high risks among 47,XXY mosaics.  \n CONCLUSIONS: Additional well-designed epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify which patients with KS are at a high risk of developing MBC and to distinguish between possible predisposing factors, including altered endogenous hormones. \n Major risk factors for developing male BC include clinical disorders involving hormonal imbalances (excess of estrogen or a deficiency of testosterone as seen in patients with Klinefelter syndrome) and a positive family history for breast cancer.  \n Patients with 47, XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer, germ cell tumours and non Hodgkin lymphomas, but rarely acute myeloid leukaemia.  \n Breast cancer in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome is reported. \n The increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol at the therapy with androgens might be responsible for the development of breast cancer in Klinefelter's syndrome. \n Patients with a 47,XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have an increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer and germ cell tumors, but rarely malignant hematologic disorders. \n The frequencies of diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, and germ cell neoplasia increases in Klinefelter's syndrome. \n There is evidence, however, to suggest that Klinefelter's males have an increased risk of breast cancer that approaches three percent. \n Klinefelter syndrome has been consistently associated with breast cancer in men (MBC).<br><b>CASE REPORT</b>: We report a 54-year old man was diagnosed as synchronous bilateral breast cancer with Klinefelter syndrome. \n These results support a hormonal etiology for breast cancer in men and for prostate cancer and suggest that men with Klinefelter

include BRCA2 mutations, which are believed to account for the majority of inherited breast cancer in men, Klinefelter syndrome, and a positive family history. \n Those affected by Klinefelter's syndrome are at increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and lung cancer. \n CONCLUSIONS These results support a hormonal etiology for breast cancer in men and for prostate cancer and suggest that men with Klinefelter syndrome may be at substantially elevated risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and, perhaps, lung cancer. \n Compared with the general population, men with Klinefelter syndrome had higher mortality from lung cancer (SMR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0 to 2.0), breast cancer (SMR = 57.8, 95% CI = 18.8 to 135.0), and non-Hodgkin

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: Randomized controlled trials have shown that simvastatin and intravenous magnesium do not prevent DCI or improve functional outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). \n Conclusions Simvastatin showed no benefits in decreasing the incidence of vasospasm, DCI, or all-cause mortality after aneurysmal SAH. We conclude that patients with SAH should not be treated routinely with simvastatin during the acute stage. \n We found no statistically significant effects on vasospasm detected by transcranial cerebral Doppler (relative risk [RR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-1.49), delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1.14), or all-cause mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.67-1.54). \n BACKGROUND: Simvastatin might be beneficial to the patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, the results remained controversial.  \n CONCLUSIONS: Compared to control intervention, simvastatin intervention was found to have no influence on delayed ischaemic deficit, delayed cerebral infarction, mRS\u22642, vasospasm, ICU stay, hospital stay, and mortality in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. \n Current evidence does not support prophylactic use of clazosentan, magnesium, or simvastatin.  \n Recently, acute simvastatin treatment was not shown to be beneficial in neurological outcome using modified Rankin Scale. \n CONCLUSIONS: The current study does not support that acute simvastatin treatment improves cognitive outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. \n CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that 80 mg simvastatin treatment was effective in preventing cerebral vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH, but did not improve the clinical outcome in Korean patients. \n High-Dose Simvastatin Is Effective in Preventing Cerebral Vasospasm after Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Prospective Cohort Study in Korean Patients. \n CONCLUSIONS\nThe current study does not support that acute simvastatin treatment improves cognitive outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. \n CONCLUSIONS\nHigh-dose simvastatin treatment should not be prescribed routinely for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. \n Randomized controlled trials have shown that simvastatin and intravenous magnesium do not prevent DCI or improve functional outcomes after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). \n CONCLUSIONS\nCompared to control intervention, simvastatin intervention was found to have no influence on delayed ischaemic deficit, delayed cerebral infarction, mRS\u22642, vasospasm, ICU stay, hospital stay, and mortality in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. \n CONCLUSIONS The current study does not support that acute simvastatin treatment improves cognitive outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. \n CONCLUSIONS High-dose simvastatin treatment should not be prescribed routinely for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. \n CONCLUSIONS Compared to control intervention, simvastatin intervention was found to have no influence on delayed ischaemic deficit, delayed cerebral infarction, mRS\u22642, vasospasm, ICU stay, hospital stay, and mortality in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. \n There were also no differences in DID, delayed cerebral infarction, favorable mRS outcome, and MMSE scores, and MMSE-assessed cognitive impairment between both groups.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: The current study does not support that acute simvastatin treatment improves cognitive outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.<br> \n Does simvastatin improve outcomes of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nThe question is asking whether simvastatin improves outcomes of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ:  In the phase III PACIFIC trial consolidation with durvalumab, an anti-PDL-1 antibody, was associated with survival benefit in patients diagnosed with LA-NSCLC who responded to concurrent chemoradiotherapy. \n METHODS: An electronic literature search was performed of public databases (MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica dataBASE [EMBASE], and Cochrane) and conference proceedings for trials using PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab, durvalumab, and avelumab) in patients with NSCLC. \n Durvalumab in non-small-cell lung cancer patients: current developments. \n Single-agent durvalumab showed clinical efficacy and a manageable safety profile in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, particularly the \u226525% PD-L1+ population. \n Six drugs including one CTLA-4 blocker (ipilimumab), two PD-1 blockers (nivolumab and pembrolizumab) and three PD-L1 blockers (atezolizumab, avelumab and durvalumab) are approved for the treatment of different types of cancers including both solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer and Merkel cell cancer as well as hematological tumors such as classic Hodgkin's lymphoma.  \n PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The therapeutic armamentarium for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer has evolved considerably over the past years. Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death-1 such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab or programmed cell death ligand 1 such as atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab have shown favorable efficacy results in this patient population in the first-line and second-line setting. \n In addition, preclinical and early clinical evidence suggests that chemotherapy and radiation may work synergistically with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy to promote antitumor immunity, which has led to the initiation of clinical trials testing these drugs in patients with stage III NSCLC. A preliminary report of a randomized phase III trial, the PACIFIC trial, demonstrated an impressive increase in median progression-free survival with consolidative durvalumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor, compared with observation after cCRT.  \n ICI, such as the PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab, have already been marketed for the treatment of pretreated patients with advanced NSCLC. \n The PACIFIC trial assessing durvalumab after standard chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC has already met its primary endpoint and the potential of durvalumab will be reinforced if phase III randomized studies of first-line (MYSTIC trial) and second or subsequent (ARCTIC trial) lines of therapy demonstrate superiority over the current standard of care.<br> \n Is durvalumab used for lung cancer treatment?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.. In the phase III PACIFIC trial, consolidation with durvalumab was associated with a survival benefit in patients diagnosed with LA-NSCLC who responded to concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: The initial results suggests that obese children have higher cognitive scores and that this result is driven by those who are female, non-indigenous and live in an urban region. \n On the other end of the weight distribution, indigenous children who are severely thin or thin have significantly lower cognitive scores, a relationship that holds after correcting for possible bias and appears to strengthen between ages of five and eight. \n Obesity is associated with decreased cognitive function, reduced gray matter volume, and impaired white matter integrity in cognition-related brain areas in patients with MDD. \n The data suggest that being overweight or obese in midlife may be more detrimental to subsequent age-related cognitive decline than being overweight or obese at later stages of the life span \n Poor cognitive performance was present in 37% of the sample. General obesity (BMI>or = 25) and poor cognition were strongly associated in the presence of abdominal obesity. Poor cognition was negatively associated with overweight (BMI 23-25) with normal waist circumference. \n BMI could be used as a candidate risk marker to identify people at higher risk of cognitive deficits, and as an intervention target for modifications of cognitive outcomes. \n Obesity is a common medical illness that is increasingly recognised as conferring risk of decline in cognitive performance, independent of other comorbid medical conditions. \n Overweight and obesity are associated with an increased risk of subnormal intellectual performance in young adult males. Subjects with low birth weight and adolescent overweight/obesity are at particular risk of subnormal performance. \n Impairments in cognitive function have been associated with obesity in both people and rodents. \n Obesity in the pre-school years was associated with poorer outcomes for some cognitive measures in this study. Stronger relationships between obesity and cognition or educational attainment may emerge later in childhood. \n There is parallel evidence that people who are overweight or obese tend to perform worse on a variety of cognitive tasks \n While research in this area is growing, our knowledge of obesity-related cognitive dysfunction and brain alterations has not yet been synthesized. \n The present review integrates the recent literature regarding patterns of obesity-related cognitive dysfunction and brain alterations and also indicates potential mechanisms for these neuropathological changes. \n The review culminates in a preliminary model of obesity-related cognitive dysfunction and suggestions for future research, including the potential reversibility of these changes with weight-loss.<br> \n Evidence for the increased prevalence of diabetes and obesity is reviewed as it relates to cognitive decline. \n These articles indicate that the age of onset of Type 1 diabetes may be relevant to future cognitive function and that disease duration of Type 2 diabetes and sociocultural factors are related to cognitive decline during the aging process. \n This special issue concludes with a conceptual framework for linking obesity and diabetes with accelerated cognitive decline as related to the aging process. \n The adverse effects of diabetes and obesity on cognitive functioning are increasingly well recognized. \n Moreover, these studies show that distressing environmental circumstances can adversely influence neurocognitive dysfunction associated with obesity and diabetes. \n Is obesity related to cognitive decline?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step..\nThe initial results suggest that obese children have higher cognitive scores, and this result is driven by those who are female, non-indigenous, and live in an urban region.

Thus, the answer is (b) no\n\nQ: De Novo Truncating Mutations in WASF1 Cause Intellectual Disability with Seizures. \n Here, using exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, we identified three de novo truncating mutations in WAS protein family member 1 (WASF1) in five unrelated individuals with moderate to profound intellectual disability with autistic features and seizures. WASF1, also known as WAVE1, is part of the WAVE complex and acts as a mediator between Rac-GTPase and actin to induce actin polymerization. The three mutations connected by Matchmaker Exchange were c.1516C>T (p.Arg506Ter), which occurs in three unrelated individuals, c.1558C>T (p.Gln520Ter), and c.1482delinsGCCAGG (p.Ile494MetfsTer23). All three variants are predicted to partially or fully disrupt the C-terminal actin-binding WCA domain. Functional studies using fibroblast cells from two affected individuals with the c.1516C>T mutation showed a truncated WASF1 and a defect in actin remodeling.

immunization programs \n Rotavirus vaccine RIX4414 (Rotarix\u2122): a pharmacoeconomic review of its use in the prevention of rotavirus gastroenteritis in developed countries. \n In addition, various naturalistic studies have demonstrated 'real-world' effectiveness after the introduction of widespread rotavirus vaccination programmes in the community setting. \n The monovalent rotavirus vaccine RIX4414 (Rotarix\u2122) is administered as a two-dose oral series in infants and has demonstrated protective efficacy against RVGE in clinical trials conducted in developed countries. \n Numerous cost-effectiveness analyses have been conducted in developed countries in which a universal rotavirus vaccination programme using RIX4414 was compared with no universal rotavirus vaccination programme. \n It is also difficult to draw conclusions regarding the cost effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine RIX4414 relative to that of the pentavalent rotavirus vaccine, which is administered as a three-dose oral series. \n Although indirect comparisons in cost-effectiveness analyses indicate that RIX4414 provided more favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios when each vaccine was compared with no universal rotavirus vaccination programme, results were generally sensitive to vaccine costs. \n A rotavirus vaccine for prophylaxis of infants against rotavirus gastroenteritis. \n A live attenuated monovalent rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) containing human rotavirus strain RIX4414 of G1P1A P[8] specificity is being developed to meet the global need. \n Rotarix significantly reduced rotavirus gastroenteritis episodes and rotavirus-related hospitalizations in vaccinated infants compared with placebo recipients (P < 0.05). \n We describe the intussusception epidemiology prior to rotavirus vaccine, temporal association of intussusception cases to administration of rotavirus vaccine, and estimate the additional number of intussusception cases that may be associated with rotavirus vaccine. \n Epidemiology of intussusception before and after rotavirus vaccine introduction in Fiji. \n In 2012, Fiji introduced rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix, GSK) into the national immunisation schedule. \n Four trials of RIT 4237 bovine rotavirus vaccine, one trial of group A RRV-1 rhesus rotavirus vaccine, and one trial of rhesus-human reassortant rotavirus vaccines D x RRV and DS1 x RRV were carried out between 1983-1989. \n Problems associated with the use of any oral rotavirus vaccine include acid lability of the vaccine virus, which requires buffering, and a slight but significant interference of oral poliovirus vaccine with the uptake of rotavirus vaccine. \n In the near future, oral heterologous rotavirus vaccines may be available for prevention of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. \n There was no apparent difference between bovine and rhesus-based rotavirus vaccines in the protective efficacy against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. \n Efficacy studies of this vaccine in 6-12 month-old children gave results characteristic of the performance of oral rotavirus vaccines in general: 58% protective efficacy against any rotavirus gastroenteritis and 82% against \"clinically significant\" gastroenteritis. \n Live oral rotavirus vaccine strain RIT 4237, derived from group A bovine rotavirus NCDV, was given to human volunteers in Tampere, Finland in 1982. \n Targeted efforts to evaluate indirect effects of rotavirus vaccine in low income countries are required to understand the total impact of rotavirus vaccine on the global burden of rotavirus disease. \n Widespread introduction of rotavirus vaccines has led to major reductions in the burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis worldwide. \n While rotavirus vaccine indirect effects have been demonstrated in high and middle income countries, there are very little data from low income countries where force of infection, population structures and vaccine schedules differ. \n Measuring indirect effects of rotavirus vaccine in low income countries. \n Intussusception among recipients of rotavirus vaccine: reports to the vaccine adverse event reporting system. \n Rotavirus vaccine was licensed on August 31, 1998, and subsequently recommended for routine use among infants. \n To describe the cases of intussusception among rotavirus vaccine recipients reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System from October 1998 through December 1999. \n Infants vaccinated with rotavirus vaccine in the United States. \n There were 98 confirmed cases of intussusception after vaccination with rotavirus vaccine reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System; 60 of these developed intussusception within 1 week after vaccination. \n Using a passive surveillance system for vaccine

Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: The patient developed progressive lung fibrosis under several immunosuppressants and was started on nintedanib, with clinical and functional stabilization. Nintedanib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that blocks several profibrotic pathways, inhibiting proliferation and migration of fibroblasts and decreasing the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins. It is approved for idiopathic lung fibrosis and has demonstrated good results in inhibiting migration and proliferation of systemic sclerosis dermal fibroblasts, constituting a promising agent for systemic sclerosis-associated lung fibrosis. \n BACKGROUND: Nintedanib is an inhibitor targeting platelet-derived growth factor receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases that has recently been approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  \n CONCLUSION: Nintedanib targets core features of SSc in Fra2-transgenic mice and ameliorates histological features of pulmonary arterial hypertension, destructive microangiopathy and pulmonary and dermal fibrosis. These data might have direct implications for the ongoing phase III clinical trial with nintedanib in SSc-associated interstitial lung disease. \n In light of the ongoing advances in our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying interstitial lung disease in systemic sclerosis, this review also summarizes novel treatment approaches, presenting clinical and preclinical evidence for rituximab, tocilizumab, pirfenidone, and nintedanib, as well as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and lung transplantation. \n Pirfenidone and nintedanib are emerging agents that exert pleiotropic effects, reflective of the multiple mechanistic pathways of IPF.  \n Design of a randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial of nintedanib in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SENSCIS\u2122). \n The SENSCIS\u2122 trial is a randomised, placebo-controlled Phase III trial that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with SSc-ILD (NCT02597933). \n CONCLUSIONS: This trial will assess the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with SSc-ILD. \n Nintedanib for Systemic Sclerosis-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease. \n Nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been shown to have antifibrotic and antiinflammatory effects in preclinical models of systemic sclerosis and ILD. \n METHODS\n\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in patients with ILD associated with systemic sclerosis. \n CONCLUSIONS\n\nAmong patients with ILD associated with systemic sclerosis, the annual rate of decline in FVC was lower with nintedanib than with placebo; no clinical benefit of nintedanib was observed for other manifestations of systemic sclerosis. \n Potential of Nintedanib in Treatment of Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Diseases. \n Anti-fibrotic nintedanib-a new opportunity for systemic sclerosis patients? \n Newer agents with anti-fibrotic properties, such as pirfenidone or nintedanib, might hold promise also for the pulmonary fibrosis seen in sarcoidosis. \n This suggests that nintedanib inhibits fundamental processes in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. \n This suggests that nintedanib and pirfenidone , drugs known to slow disease progression in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , may also slow the progression of ILD associated with systemic autoimmune diseases \n In the SENSCIS\u00ae trial , nintedanib reduced the rate of ILD progression in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated ILD \n Nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been shown to have antifibrotic and antiinflammatory effects in preclinical models of systemic sclerosis and ILD. \n The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of nintedanib on a cellular model of SSc-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD). \n OBJECTIVES\nNintedanib is approved for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and was demonstrated to slow disease progression in patients with IPF by reducing decline in forced vital capacity by 50%. \n Nintedanib: new indication for systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease. \n Nintedanib (Ofev\u2122), an oral triple kinase inhibitor targeting pro-fibrotic pathways, has been used for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). \n These data might have direct implications for the ongoing phase III clinical trial with nintedanib in SSc-associated interstitial lung disease. \n Based on positive results from phase III, placebo-controlled, randomized comparative clinical trial conducted in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD), nintedanib received marketing approval in the United States and Japan for the treatment of SSc-ILD. \n Nintedanib is an intracellular inhibitor of tyrosine kinases that has been approved for treatment of IPF and has recently been shown to reduce the rate of lung function decline in patients with ILD associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc-ILD). \n Does nintedanib hold promise for lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis?\nAnswer Choices:\n(a) yes\n(b) no\nA:Let's think step by step. llama rationale: Let's think step by step.\nThe passage discusses nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and its potential in treating systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD).

    "Let's think step by step. Yes, SMAD6 variants substantially increase the risk of both nonsyndromic and syndromic presentations of craniosynostosis, especially metopic synostosis. Thus, the answer is (a) yes\n\nQ: SMAD6 variants in craniosynostosis: genotype and phenotype evaluation. \n Enrichment of heterozygous missense and truncating SMAD6 variants was previously reported in nonsyndromic sagittal and metopic synostosis, and interaction of SMAD6 variants with a common polymorphism nearBMP2 (rs1884302) was proposed to contribute to inconsistent penetrance. We determined the occurrence of SMAD6 variants in all types of craniosynostosis, evaluated the impact of different missense variants on SMAD6 function, and tested independently whether rs1884302 genotype significantly modifies the phenotype.METHODS: We performed resequencing of SMAD6 in 795 unsolved patients with any type of craniosynostosis and genotyped rs1884302 in SMAD6-positive individuals and relatives. We examined the inhibitory activity and stability of SMAD6 missense variants.RESULTS: We found 18 (2.3%) different rare damaging SMAD6 variants, with the highest prevalence in metopic synostosis (5.8%) and an 18.3-fold enrichment of loss-of-function variants comparedwith gnomAD data (P\u2009<\u200910-7). Combined with eight additional variants, \u226520/26 were transmitted from an unaffected parent but rs1884302 genotype did not predict phenotype.CONCLUSION: Pathogenic SMAD6 variants substantially increase the risk of both nonsyndromic and syndromic presentations of craniosynostosis, especially metopic synostosis.
